10.0,BEST SPIDER-MAN FILM EVER,"Just when you thought Jon Watts couldn't out-do himself, he does it again with No Way Home. Absolutely LOVED every moment in this film. Without giving away spoilers, I can 100% guarantee to everyone that this is the BEST Spider-Man film of all time.

Hats off to the director, cast, crew and everyone else involved!!!!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Best Spidey Ever,Loved it! Start to finish this movie is awesome and absolutely ends up in the top 3 of the best in the MCU. So good I went twice over the opening weekend and will watch it again.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A perfect 10,"One movie that brought the entire childhood in front of us, made the memes real and by far THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE EVER. Watched it on the first day of release and made sure I didnt spoil anything and no one spoiled it for me. A must watch for Spidey Geeks and the Marvel-Sony collab has taken Spiderman to a whole new level.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,"Mediocre Marvel/Superhero movie, worse considering the money invested","The overall idea of the multiverse and bringing together generations of Spider-man is brilliant, but there's an obvious lack of brainpower to flesh it out.

The movie starts off pretty slowly and goes on for a long time. I was not having a good feeling.

The movie went off the rails when Dr. Strange did the amnesia spell. No one's motivations really made any sense, from the villains to Spider-Man x 3. There were no interesting stakes and the multiverse theory had so many holes I couldn't get invested in any of it. Why don't Andrew Garfield and Toby McGuire want to get back to their universes immediately? Aren't they worried about what's happening there in their absence? Nope, they're fine to just hang out in this universe for however long the movie needs. Why are the super villains coming to this Spider-Man, in this universe and not any one of the infinite other universes? Why doesn't the amnesia spell traverse the multiverse, yet people can traverse it?

The movie consists of three basic parts, jumbled together: a lot of standing around with stupid dialogue and ""humor"" (the scene with obese kid's mom and the cobwebs), and action scenes and ""emotional scenes"" that don't connect. For example, Marisa Tomei is terrible; she doesn't exude wisdom or any genuine soul or emotion. Another example of the stupidity is the climax, where Dr. Strange is holding the portals closed (?) so other super villains can't get through, and tells Holland to say his goodbyes before the next amnesia spell. Well, Spider-Man takes his sweet time saying goodbye. There was never any real tension, nothing at stake, nothing made any sense.

I'm not a fan of Tom Holland, Zendaya, or the obese kid-their conversations, personalities, looks, and chemistry are just boring. There are no sparks between Holland and Zendaya (they're a real life couple?)-those two actors are not good actors, in my opinion. Andrew Garfield and Toby McGuire are very good, although their direction and lines are overly sappy-their acting and stories are enough to carry the emotional beats, if they were given more restrained lines and physical reactions.

Considering all the money and the talent that can buy, this was weakly executed. 6/10 is fair.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Amazing movie,I loved Spider-Man no way home I liked it better than all of the other Spider-Man movies. I think Tom holland and Andrew Garfield movies are always good. You must see the movie and the only thing I would change was the ending where Peter had to forget MJ and his best friend.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,berkaysunn,"I watched and liked it.

The Spider-Man of my childhood is Tobey Maguire.

For me Tobey Maguire is a real Spider-Man and also Sam Raimi in the best Spider-Man costume. Sam Raimi Spider-Man Red and Black is not up for discussion.

Tobey, it's good to see you again, man.

Andrew Garfield is a handsome man.

Spider-Man suits Andrew Garfield too, but whoever did the costume design sucks. Especially it follows like a basket ball..

Tom Holland is a boy Spider-Man. I can't tell if I like your costume Spider-Man.

Tobey non-tech Spider-Man

Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland Tech.

To me, non-tech Spider-Man is always better and has a realism. Sure welcome to the world of technology

It was nice seeing you, Tobey Maguire.

I wish you to make a movie again as Spider-Man and even as Spider-Man 4 again...",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A perfect spiderman movie,"The first two two spiderman movies were more like ironman jr. And the movies was weak at being emotional and the plot was very light hearted. But, this one is a perfect spiderman movie. It shows the consequences of being spiderman, as the green goblin says in this movie. ""No good deed goes unpunished."" And spiderman is a superhero that works alone and makes his costume on his own. This movie showed that even though almost for the half of the movie it relied on stark tech suits like the upgraded suit, and the iron spider suit. Also, peter meeting other spidermen and learning from them was really awesome. Even though the first 1 hour of the movie was very messy and has a very cheap plot, I believe this was the perfect spiderman movie.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Such a great marvel movie of all time,"Mind-blowing it's lot of emotions , action ,VFX and comedy also .such a great directing ,acting , screen play okay I have no words.thanks marvel studio for this amazing movie and love you docter strage.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Best Spider-Man we've gotten so far,"Rating: 8.2

This was the spiderman to end all spider men. Looked incredible, and was as sensibly written as you can get when it comes to multiverse media. The stakes were high (aunt may dies), the pacing was fast, the humor wasn't forced, the callbacks to prior spiderman films were clean, and most of all: the ending wasn't a copout everyone forgot peter parker; a fitting consequence to peter trying to ""have it all"". I didn't like how Strange caved to peters requests when he first cast the spell then blamed peter for the fallout when he could've just not added the extra parameters. But the plot needed that catalyst to start the drama. The dialogue between the spidermen was everything you could've hoped for. Excellent watch.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,Flawed script that ruins everything,"A guy starts a moralizing crusade to magically heal a couple of evil guys from parallel universes on expense of the lives of everyone he loved. They disappear and he is left on the ruins of his own life, somehow satisfies with all the mess he creates.

Oh, and thus also created an inter-dimensional breach that will be used in the following movies.

It was cool to see all the stars from past movies, good choreography and acting, but the script is so unbelievably dull it is hard to digest anything that is happening on the screen.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
3.0,Boring and overly emotional,"I was so hyped for this movie, as I believe everyone was. This movie pulled so many un-logical moves, and made villians heroes. I mean it's cool to have all spider-man's in the same universe... But it is done poorly. The word ""love"" is said about dozen times, yet didn't hold any meaning nor push the narative in any way, shape or form. It was bland and overhyped. I know the film was made for the masses, but in my personal opinion, a good idea, not ""at all"" well executed.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
3.0,A total waste of time,"I rarely write reviews, but this time I'll make an exception: this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

I wish there was a spell to go back in time and prevent myself to step into the movie theatre. Dull, boring, annoying don't even begin to describe how awful it is. I have no idea why this movies gets praised as much as it does.

I give it three stars instead of one because the animation on the credits it' s pretty cool.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,The absolute WORST Spiderman yet...,I don't get it... did other people watch the same film? Perhaps they actually don't care about Spiderman and WHO he is. But yay! In this film we get to see him SPLIT PERSONALITIES... and WOW what a TRAINWRECK DISNEY created. Don't they know all they have to do is FOLLOW THE COMICS??? And why was this thing so SAD??? Ugh... will NEVER watch again. Marvel should have NEVER sold out to Disney which can be seen just by checking out their stock fall.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,I Loved It Each and Every Moment,"It's A Great Christmas Movie.

Great Visuals Michael Giacchino's Soundtrack Is Awesome Loved The Screenplay Emotions Worked Out Funny Didn't Waste a single Character William Defoe SPIDEY-SUITS CLIMAX is Great Feel good.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
2.0,"Not deserving of a 8,7 score","Yet again, a marvel blockbuster seem to break the internet, and score fantastic reviews, for seemingly no good reason at all.

If you are 10 years old and want to sit and fart and laugh at mediocre jokes through out the movie, then great. If you however are someone who enjoys well-written, touching and intelligent story-telling, with meaning and soul behind it, then this is certinly not for you. But then again, you shouldn't ever expect such things from a studio like Marvel.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Back to Marvel Excellence,"I have to be honest here, after too progressive and boring ""eternals"", underwhelming ""black widow"", awful ""captain marvel"" and a few dissapointing series (no I did not like Marvel tv shows), I did not expect much from this movie, but they trully delivered their Marvel excellence. One thing can be said for sure, Tom Holland is a rightful heir to Robert Downey Jr. In this universe. He is the main draw and I hope they will give him few more movies of his own.

So many refernces to previous spidey movies and cartoons, it's amazing. Andrew Garfield deserve one more movie of his own. They could explore what happened after.

I took a star off the perfect rating because the story lacks logic, and spiderman trully acts stupid after what he has been through.

New Dr. Strange can't come soon enough.

Advised for all!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Absolutely brilliant! UNDERSTANDS SPIDEY,"Forget Tobey and Andrew for a minute this movie is spectacular without them. This film could've very well not included the old Spider-Men and have been just as amazing. This movie understands the sacrifices that have to be made when you're Spider-Man that there are always consequences for your actions even the good ones. The cinematography and writing of this movie is excellent, the final swing is triumphant, and the movie is spectacular. Not to mention all of the cameos and the fact that the Spidermen weren't just cameos and they were big characters in the movie and they're shaping who Tom *Spider-Man* becomes in these movies to come.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,Disappointed - why can't we just have a happy ending?,"Like the title - why can't we just have a happy ending for once in these later Marvel movies?!

Spider-Man: No Way Home just left all of us disappointed and frustrated that everything great the previous two movies, and the Avengers parts, gave us with regards of Spider-Man was all undone here due to a rather uninteresting script that was the results from the Disney-Sony debacle... Multiverse?! Sorry but this wasn't at all what I hoped for and frankly the high review score made me expect so much more than this...

I had avoided the trailers and leaks prior to watching it a couple days ago with the kids so I didn't know much more than some of the actors that was going to return to old characters, but I was expecting more cameos than what was showed on the silver screen?!

I'm not going to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet but was it really necessary to kill you know who?

And Dr. Strange all of a sudden with a completely different persona? We were 100% sure it wasn't him at all initially but we were wrong. Sadly. And the ending was by far the worst one in any of these later Marvel movies simply because it undid EVERYTHING the previous Tom Holland Spider-Man movies had accomplished... And why does every Marvel movie nowadays have be so extremely sad...? Why can't we go home feeling happy, filled with joy and awesome after watching the movie instead of like now, going home feeling sad and empty, and wondering why they destroyed everything great that we the audience came to love about the latest incarnation of Spider-Man?

We were all disappointed about the latter half and it's such a shame because Spider-Man was important to the whole saga since he's the only one still being a normal person! Ant-Man sort of fits the description too, but here we have a teenager doing teenager stuff and that's why it turned out so great with Tom Holland being said teenager!

I hope there are no more Spider-Man instalments because I just can't see them going anywhere from this apart from even further south... :(

If you are going to watch this then make sure to bring plenty of tissue paper because you will cry. A lot. And you will not feel uplifted and joyful when done. Even if you're not as disappointed as we were you will feel sad and wishing things didn't unfold like they did.

Such a shame because to me Spider-Man really was the replacement Iron Man!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Pops wasn't impressed. But I was,"I think this film is for a certain age. One that can enjoy it for nostalgia.

I was sat next to my 12 year old and my dad at 75.

I'm 36.

I felt at times it was slow and predictable.

Then when fighting started I was thrown into action packed fun. Had its moments of sadness and cheeky laughter.

But all in all. I would watch again and would probably like it more.

My 12 year old said she liked it ,but the green goblin was scary at times. I agreed. William played his part perfectly and reminded us that he's a spectacular actor.

My dad I could hear sighing quite a few times. And when the other spidermen turned up he gave a loud ""oh god why"". That made me regret bringing him as he was quite lost as to what was happening.

And at the end of the film was not a happy bunny.

But to be fair I think it might have been paying £30 for 3 small popcorn and some drinks that started him off.

I don't think he liked the playful attitude of Tom Holland and said that Spider-Man was over for him. He liked the Toby Maguire ones and that is that.

So yeah.

Make your own minds up.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,An extremely very bad movie!,"If you don't want to waste your time and money, you should skip this movie. That such a bad movie I have ever seen!

The whole story runs just around a stubborn kid who make the problem for everyone. At the end, the entire of characters do dumb ass like a kid. I think it would suitable for my nephew. I will never watch any Spider Man movie, so stupid and noisy!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"""I Want You To Tell Me When You See Me Again."" - Three generations of Spider-Man, where it's all about the power of love and responsibility","A trilogy conclusion of incredible emotional power, which brings together entire cinematic universes and periods in a work unprecedented in the history of cinema, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic love letter to films by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, as well as those starring Tom Holland, which also comes full circle both with Sony's Spider-Man Universe and the licensing agreement with Marvel Studios, while opening the door to the next adventures of Spider-Man. Only in our wildest dreams could we have imagined such a feat being achieved while becoming one of the best superhero movies ever made. Benefiting from all the skills and passion of its cast and crew, it sets a milestone and also marks the best Marvel movie of all time.

This especially since this brilliant twist on two decades of Spider-Men movies doesn't have an ounce of propaganda and/or messy storyline that plagues some MCU movies: It's a gem, with nothing but substance and heart! And, precisely because Peter Parker/Spiderman has too much of a good heart and believes he can change fundamentally bad people, he loses everyone close to him in one ultimate sacrifice.

""With great power comes great responsibility"" seems to make love impossible for Peter Parker again. One more bittersweet ending in Peter's existence, which made Zendaya say she would have liked to see Peter and MJ go to college together. Indeed, what fan could disagree with her? Who isn't heartbroken and hoping for our college sweethearts to be reunited in the next chapter of their life? By the way, is there any petition for Spider-Man 4 storyline to reunite them as Zendaya wanted for the ending of No Way Home?

In the meantime, we should be able to dry our tears a little with the confirmation of the engagement of our two lovebirds in our part of the multiverse, right?

Spider-Man: No Way Home is about real friends teaming up and true love. Essential values that make it a major and unforgettable cinematographic achievement.

I saw it in theaters in January and now on DVD, for the second time, and it's still a shock that makes me shed seas of tears.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Really good buuuut...,"I really enjoyed the movie, the cameos and surprises the movie had made me smile and shout but one thing I really didn't like was that at serious moments or moments that should be serious, there are tons and tons of jokes. But thats honestly the only thing I didnt like, everything else is pretty good.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"Yes, it absolutely delivers what you want to see!","Phase 4 hasn't got off to the best of starts. Far from home suffered from post Endgame fatigue and could never reach the hights of its immediate predecessor.

Shang Chi was fun and enjoyable; but they tried to fit 2-3 movies worth of content into a single outing, resulting in ideas that were never explored, too many characters to develop and important pay offs that felt rushed.

The Eternals landed to a lukewarm reception that was still probably warmer than it deserved. Generally, it dragged and failed to entertain in more than brief doses.

The various TV Series have been extremely mixed in both their overall quality and even the quality of individual episodes.

So, the expectations for No Way Home were extremely high...and I was worried that that film hype might be writing cheques that its butt couldn't cash.

However I need not have worried. It not only wrote the cheques but they cleared promptly when cashed.

There are a few plot holes that it's best not to think about and some of the characters seem to be a bit inconsistent with their motivations and behaviour, but aside from that, it knocks this one out of the park.

The script is pretty tight, it's well acted and it delivers the right pacing without any real second act boredom. I'm a heavy smoker and if I make it through a whole film without craving a smoke, its a good film. In this case, not only did the film not give me time to crave one, I genuinely forgot I smoked until I got back to the car afterwards!

This film shows that the MCU can still absolutely get the job done when they are working with the right casting, writers and characters.

Yes, there were genuine emotional moments and I did find a tear in my eye...but not at the part you would imagine once you've watched it. Yes that was sad but it was a supporting characters moment of redemption that did it for me. Managing to do something that turned out extremely badly last time they attempted it.

I'm not crying...you're crying! You will know it when you see it!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Amazing!,"The originals have always been my fav Spiderman movies, then I saw this movie! All around a great movie. 3 Spidermans, handful of the best villains! Strongly recommend this movie!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,Nice to watch it once,"This was just fan service. It does not bring anything into the MCU. Lazy writing that makes no sense.

I honestly enjoyed seeing the 3 Spider-Man together but the storyline is far from good and the other Spider-Man are ""useless"" in this movie.

The character of Tom holland really is simple and does not develop the character like in other movies.

The end costume also looks bad for me.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
2.0,Overrated,"Beside nostalgia and fan service this movie was trash lets be real, the cgi was horrible, the plot was nonsense, writting was poor...

I gave this 2/10 for Andrew and Tobey only !",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"Spider Man, Spider Man, does whatever a spider can.","My entire family of MCU fans walked into this movie with kinda low expectations. But after the movie... god damn was it great. The villains were great, the return of some of the best spider-man villians where amazing and they are making room for new ones like Venom who is now part of the MCU! Also, how they managed to keep Tobey and Andrew a secret was amazing. The movie was emotional, exciting, suspenseful and just PURE fan service. Not to mention the Daredevil cameo and the post credit cutscenes. Which you have to experience yourself ;)

It's great that Tom's journey as the webslinger is far from over. Not to mention the room for characters like Ghost Spider and Miles Morales. Now that this movie is out, I can say one thing for sure.

It lives up to the hype.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Really fantastic movie,"Quite a bit better than Far From Home, but the plot can get confusing, and the running time is too padded and could have been shorter. It is the most profitable movie in nearly three years and one of the best reviewed Marvel films of all-time,",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,One of the best Spiderman movies out there watch it:),"I still don´t know if this is better than spider man 2(yes the original with Tobey Maguire) the second one was a masterpiece by Sam Raimi.

Now this one is up there, and you will enjoy every second of it from beginning to end.

The anticipation for a Marvel movie certainly hasn't been this high since 'Avengers: Endgame' two and a half years ago! In this movie spider man have to find himself, since he is lost and alone.. he turnes to another great artist from the marvel universe, you have to watch the movie to see it for yourself.)

The movie is very emotional and the writing is very good.

8.0,WOW,"Just watched in cinema and my gosh was I blown away! I'll try to keep it nice and consice:

9.0,"Not a masterpiece, but it will go down in history","I didn't expect it to be that good. They did an amazing job and hit right in the nostalgia.

The jokes were good(there 1-2 cringe though), they introduced us the old Spidermans with a really smart way and the villains were also really good. It had the amount of drama and brutality it needed and the music was also amazing.

The only that I was a bit meh with was the ending. I don't understand what happened in the Maguire's and Garfield's world. Did they forget everything that happened and the story changed or something else? And it's also kinda sad that Tom ended up completely alone but with a new trilogy planned we have more to see so I'm not really worried.

It was amazing, beautiful, it was a lifetime experience and I will never forget it. Remember guys, with great power...",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Long waited dream of the Spiderman Fans,"The Spiderman fans were divided into 3 categories: Tobey Maguire one, Andrew Garfield one and Tom Holland one. And to see all of them together with the villains united is a really great entertainment and fun.

9.0,About film,My favorite movie is fairy tale. I really believe that Peter will grow up faster and become even more cool than his colleagues from parallel universes.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A new beginning for a legendary superhero!,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is surely the most impressive movie of 2021 and its intensive promotion during the last few months really paid off. It closes a lot of storylines in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but on the other hand, it manages to create so many new possibilities for the upcoming years and Marvel's phase 4.

In ""No Way Home"", Peter Parker is no longer Tony Stark's apprentice. You see Tom Holland really bringing new dimensions to the character who emerges as the responsible and independent hero he is supposed to be. This is the first MCU movie in which Parker suffers and fears, he was totally desperate. Yes, he was tested in both ""Homecoming"" and ""Far from Home"" but the general tone in these previous movies was rather comedic and entertaining. Here there is nothing about a school trip to Europe, a science competition or a Homecoming party. ""No Way Home"" is dramatic, thrilling and nostalgic. It is simply one of the darkest MCU movies together with ""Infinity War"".

In this regard, I would point out the huge influence of ""Spider-Man: The Animated Series"" as one of the greatest animation series ever to be made. The multiverse, the collaboration with both Daredevil and Dr. Strange, the brutal fight against the Green Goblin and the relationship with MJ were all amazingly portrayed in the spirit of the Animated Series but the highlight of the movie was Peter's relationship with his aunt May. ""No Way Home"" follows the main tradition that Peter remembers who he truly is through his parental figure. Marisa Tomei's performance is absolutely amazing and (perhaps) her final scene in the MCU is (from my point of view) the most emotional in these 27 movies.

To conclude, this movie brings everything that a Spider-Man fan would love to see. Emotional scenes, dramatic fights, different villains, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back in the game and a huge promise for the future. Will we see Peter living a new life as a poor photographer working for Jameson? Are we going to witness a Spider-Man vs. Venom storyline in the next movie? Is Kingpin entering the picture and Spider-Man's life? Is Peter going to successfully approach MJ and Ned after Doctor Strange's spell or he is going to meet a new love interest (Felicia Hardy) and new best friend (Harry Osbourne)? There is still a lot to see in potentially 3 more films.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Never been so blown away. Oh my god!,"I cannot believe the experience I just had watching this movie. I went along with my family for my son's birthday.

I had not seen one Spiderman movie in full before this but knew about them sort of. My sons gave me some rough background on them on the way there. I was fully expecting to be perhaps daydreaming or trying not to nap or checking my phone during the movie.

Instead, I COULDN'T BELIEVE what was unfolding before me! To say I was captivated and mesmerized would be a huge understatement.

The second half most especially was so spine tingling, full of intensity, speckled with tinges of sweet comedy and emotion.

Also I unexpectedly cried like some crazy person halfway through in one very sad scene and then again at the end, I was absolutely sobbing (and was subsequently embarrassed about my sniffling which I was trying to suppress in this new Covid world!).

I was completely overwhelmed, in a good way. And to think that I was doing the 'obligation kids movie' for my sons birthday.

But at the same time, I don't want to say that it's bad, because they worked on the plot, the special effects were done very cool. In general, everything is very good. But for those who had high expectations for this film, it may be disappointing. It's not really worth it. And soooo, this is my kind of personal opinion.

8.0,Emotional. But bad visuals,"The story of Peter Parker who is in conflict with his own self being split into two. Spider-Man got mature thats good. This process has some kind of emotions to it but so bland in visuals. Some good but brief action scenes. MCU rather MCM goes ahead.

2.0,Walked out after 30 minutes,"What was the point of the film. Boring & predictable. All that money, resource & great actors available & they manage to come up with this rubbish.

,fan service the movie!,"People need to learn to let the hype settle, have a good night's sleep, maybe an eggo or two, and then think about the movie before writing a 10/10 review. Maybe wipe the sweaty fog from your glasses thats been accumulating since you bought 7 tickets a month ago. I assure you if you do, you'll see a very different movie than the one you reviewed. One with a convoluted story that is, at best, hard to follow, and at its worst, BLOATED with fan service of the cheapest kind. This movie tried very hard to be nostalgic and emotional and totally fell flat on its face. Emotional scenes were well acted but with no contextual weight. The rest of the acting in this was a total campfest. There were some humorous moments but not nearly enough to give this movie a second star. I know marvel fans love anything that comes out even if its horrible, so this review is for people who actually are interested in formulating their own opinions instead of denying a movie is bad because youve been sweating in your sleep about it since the first trailer dropped.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Never thought we would ever use plural form of 'Spider-Man',"What a damn kickass movie it has been... I wept at the demise of Iron man in Avengers - Endgame and was very dismayed that there wouldn't be anything great than 'End game' to look forward from Marvel... However this one just restores the faith in Marvel again.... Wow... WOW WOW... What an entertaining flick this is.

Coming to the movie, I warn you guys that for the first time my review has got spoilers as I can't contain my excitement after such surreal experience... Read it on your own risk

As the movie begins, first five minutes into it the background score makes you groove your body to the music & just hypnotizes into the spidey world, felt great....

And then the bridge sequence thrills you and makes you feel good about being crazy of MARVEL movies, it's a great fight sequence.... The Duel between Dr. Strange and Avenger Spider-Man is whole lot of a different ball together that I have no words to express... The mirror dimensional sequence and the math that Spidey brings into it is such a great idea that it's a proof why we really adore & are obsessed about Marvel movies.

And not to miss that the crowd went crazy on Doc Octopus entry, ppl were actually screaming like hell on an entry of a villian (that's how well the people are connected to yester year Spiderman-2 that they remember the antagonist too)...

The scream grew much louder on the entry of Green Goblet (villian from SM-1)at this moment I wished Tobey should show up as Spiderman based on logic that if villian returned due to spell of Dr. Strange how the hero could be left from returning.

And then Andrew Garfield shows up as Spiderman, the crowd echoed in cheerful screaming, and at this moment I was nervous that will Tobey show up or not citing his age, did he agree to work in this one or not and while I was busy in these thoughts - the most humble, loving neighborhood guy shows up on the screen as Peter Parker and that's when the whole hall ROARED in celebration, literally everyone shouted their lungs out in jubilation.... I thought it was only me who was wishing to see Tobey to come on screen but to my surprise everyone who loves spidey was also dying for the same magic even if it were to be just a comeo

And just when all the three Spider-Mans team up... the excitement, fun and adreline rush gets tripled (Never in my wildest thoughts I imagined there would be a time or need to use plural for Spiderman 😝😝)

The moment all the three Spider-Mans fling into sky, the theater reverberated into thunderous euphoric mood 💥💥💥🕺🕺🕺

Even before Iron man came into existence in 2008, I was spidey fan despite of having Superman owing to my fondness for Tobey Maguire and this movie today is very special to reliving my memories as teenager from 2002 who was awestruck by the Spiderman movie back then.

Well to conclude, this one is a hell of a roller coaster ride that one should definitely board to feel some great experience of entertainment, you won't regret this ride for sure .... And to tell you more about it... everyone was so enjoying and celebrating this movie that, a dialouge from first movie in 2002 came up and crowd echoed chanting it ""With great Power, comes Great responsibility"", that's how Marvel had its spell on audience... Just incredible 👌👏👏",Spider-Man: No Way Home

6.0,Ok.,"It wasn't as grand and spectacular as everyone rave about. I was expecting something marvellous, but all I get was a half filled glass of water that should've been filled and overflown. A missed opportunity to fully utilise the awe-inspiring scope of the Spider-Verse.

Just like Jon Watts' previous Spider-Man films, this one too turn Peter into an annoying teenager who mess up everything. I hate it when they turn my favorite comic book characters unbearable. Tom Holland's performance was sometimes so bleak and annoying.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

9.0,Marvel capitalizes on its biggest character,"Tom Holland wraps up his first (and hopefully not last) Spider-Man trilogy with a major blockbuster. To put a bow on a year where movies made a comeback, what better way to do so than with a Marvel thriller that many had been looking for and hadn't received until now. Director, Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home) continues his relatable portrayal of the web-slinger in his 3rd straight Spider-Man film as he prepares to revamp another Marvel series that has yet to find its voice in ""The Fantastic Four"".

Synopsis:

""With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.""

What You See, Feel, and Hear

You can't typically create a superhero film, especially one of this magnitude, without the massive use of CGI and green screens. However, ever since the creation of Marvel Studios, Marvel has been able to implement a fluency with the way they create their action and environments to keep their films as relatable as possible, and this goes to show in Spider-Man: No Way Home. As I watch a film of this caliber in regards to the character portrayal I can't help but imagine the difficulty of authenticity as these actors and actresses perform stunts, express emotions, and share dialogue with a completely different environment than what's being shown on screen. While watching a superhero film I'm a major fan of the POV camera positioning. Very few times does the audience get the chance to look through the lens of a superhero character and No Way Home utilized a variety of camera positions to keep the audience immersed with each character which added a level of investment as the film went on.

Out of the 3 MCU Spider-Man films, you feel the most emotion with this film. From moments of major highs, and moments of major lows, Jon Watts tested the boundaries of emotions unlike his other films and each moment seemed to fit right into place. With a seamless balance of realistic humor and genuine fear we see the growth of Tom Holland within this specific character unlike we did with the first two films. Spider-Man is a relatable character, and because of his on-screen appearances since the character's creation in 1962 the audience has a greater attachment to him compared to others within the MCU such as characters from Shang-Chi or The Eternals. Because of that attachment I think there's a level of difficulty in separating nostalgic emotions vs. Neutral viewership when reflecting on this film.

Dialogue and execution are major focal points. With a more well rounded chemistry between Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Zendaya's MJ, their conversations and circumstances start holding higher value than ever before. This film provides a darker energy comparable to Avengers Infinity War and likewise has an unpredictable ending. In addition, we experience the best performance and scariest interpretation of a Spider-Man villain up to date.

My Take

Up until I saw this movie twice, I believed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse to be the best Spider-Man film. That has now changed. I have never put as much investment into a film as I have with this one. For a year straight I would listen and watch trusted sources dive into the story of this character and share countless predictions and I can't express how excited I was to watch this film. Because of that investment I made sure to watch the film twice; once to purely take in the experience, and once to analyze the film. Both times were exceptionally satisfying. With minor critiques on the use of CGI in certain scenes, the acting performances were great, the story was captivating, and Marvel certainly didn't disappoint with who I believe is now their biggest character.

Grade: 9.1/10.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

6.0,Looks like Marvel ran out of ideas!,"I went in with a lot of expectations from this movie. Since the previous instalments were pretty decent. But this kind of disappointed. Understand that this is a super hero movie and one cannot expect logic et al. But over all I felt the movie was just written by someone who had almost all of their creative juices evaporated.

I still don't understand the need to bring in old villains and then lead up to the same sort of climax that one is used to. The dialogues were funny but only sparsely. Some of them were down right lame.

I guess may be i've had an overdose of monotonous super hero movies.

The only good part in the movie was the visual effects.

Watch it if you are a die hard spider man fan though. It's average but it definitely isn't boring.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,A true gift for all the spidey-fans,"Went into the theatre expecting a huge nostalgia trip, taking me back to my childhood spidey-movies , and it was exactly that and better.

The story is just an instrument that moves our favorite characters in a beautyful picture, with an exceptional soundtrack.

The acting and the comedy was great, and Jon Watts has closed this trilogy with his best movie to date.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,One of greatest movie of all time,Tobey Maguire 14 years later still cast again as Spider man. Crazy to think Tobey got cast as 25 years old. While Tom is about to finish his trilogy after turning 25. Finally miss you James Franco.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,They pulled it off. They healed the wound of the previous Spiderman franchises.,"I thought the new suicide squad movie had a difficult abstract story to sell, Spider-Man: No Way Home has it waaaaay worse.

The multiverse is a concept that's hard to portray convincingly and it requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief from the audience. To make things worse they are being over ambitious bringing in the previous 2 Spiderman movie series from Sony, each of which had VERY different styles and protagonists (intentionally so). The 2nd series with Andrew Garfield also had very mixed reception to say the least.

Yet somehow they pulled it off. It's a Christmas miracle. I went in with low expectations on how much they could use Dr. Oc and the other villains but not only does this movie use all those characters a lot but it does it well.

I couldn't believe how well some of the fight scenes worked especially the ones with Dr. Oc and the one with the Green goblin. Of course there are twists and all the surprises are very well timed and executed.

Another huge difficulty I had going in was wondering how they could convince us that Dr. Strange would really cast such a insane multiverse breaking spell in the first place, especially just to save face for Spiderman. Yet even that was handled well by the writers of this movie. The trailer was definitely misleading on this one.

The visual effects match and surpass the Avengers series and while that's to be expected if they are going to sell the concept of the multiverse, it's still worth pointing out how well some of the scenes are composed. I especially loved the one fight scene near the end. Very picturesque and awe inspiring.

The pacing changes from the start of the movie to the end where there's a strange quiet and the contrast with the rest of the fast paced movie really sinks in the idea and gravity of what just happened during the last scenes.

All the actors for the spidermen were excellent, and so were actors for the villains. Some of them didn't get as much screen time or development as the others but this a 2.5 hour movie with an absolute truck load of info to dump on you and they have to do it in that time without you walking out of the theatre in frustration.

Ultimately the story is worth the watch by itself but this movie doesn't lack is any of the other dimensions you might judge it in. Comedy, fun, sadness, love, forgiveness, relief, it has it all.

This movie really feels like a long over due and very well deserved bow tie to provide closure for the 2 previous Spiderman series and this movie along with Spiderman: into the Spider-verse bring clarity and purpose for the entire Spiderman franchise moving forward.

Overall money well spent, would watch it again. A very well deserved 10/10.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Sad movie,"I loved all those actors coming back to reprise their roles, it made my day. How do you downvote a movie with so amazing actors?

But the movie is very sad. It is a movie about Spiderman leaving the MCU and descending into the shabbiness of Sony movies. Aunt May dies, everybody else forgets about him and even loses ties to the Avengers, so he has to do his own suits. The movie happens when high school is over, so no need to come back to school. Full reboot. Nobody knows Peter Parker now. Spiderman is back in a self-made lycra pyjamas.

It is not a movie. It is a Spidy-cameo special, where old figures walk our hero out of the MCU back to Sony.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Giving the fans what they want,"The movie has so much hype that I was worried it wouldn't live up but it did. Interesting story line with tons of Easter eggs.

True Spidey fans will love it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,"It is fine, but not as good as Endgame","In Spider-Man: No Way Home, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) acts like a petulant five-year-old child rather than a young adult blessed with super-powers, his puerile (and uncharacteristic) behaviour having far-reaching consequences.

The movie is poorly paced and fails to give more screentime for other spidermans (Spidermen)",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,It's good - besides the fanservice.,"I feel as though without the fanservice, the film would have been a solid 9.

There's some great scenes of emotional tragedy and coming to terms of loss - but with the addition of other characters chiming in, it adds a layer that feels unnatural.

In fact, there's a lot of scenes in this film that feel unnatural. Because this film is being driven by fanservice, every minute is spent blitzing you to old characters you've seen before in previous films. They make a few jokes, banter off other old characters, and then the film moves onto the next to do the whole thing again.

Even though this is a neat novelty, it doesn't weigh in to becoming a truely great film - which is a shame, because some of the raw emotional scenes are very clever and have absolutely nothing to do with the old universe characters they've introducted.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,"A near masterpiece of its kind, truly an incredible accomplishment for the MCU","Fans of the MCU and other Marvel films are in for a treat! My expectations were modest going in as it is very easy to mess up such a large juggling of characters. My expectations were exceeded with easily one of the best films made so far. Every time these filmmakers set a new high bar, they continue to find ways to impress.

I have to criticize some debatable character inconsistencies that act as plot devices to get things going into the chaos that is the plot. For the most part, though, it worked even if more could have been done with such an ambitious concept. The success comes mainly from what I have to say below.

Just about every factor that went into making this film was done with the utmost care. Even though I mentioned a few plot device inconsistencies above, the character focus in this movie is strong and fully realized to further expand chemistries in our main cast. The emotional appeal is stronger than ever and we really feel the power with outstanding performances and antagonist thrills.

Not only does this movie combine universes' characters, it also blends together themes presented from those universes for a whole heartedly meaningful purpose beyond fan fare. That is truly the most impressive accomplishment in my opinion. An intellectual achievement. It also did very well with combining humor with the more serious moments.

Michael Giacchino outdid himself this time around with a musical score that shows an understanding of the scenes' emotions and intensity. Too often do action movies switch too quickly between slow and fast-paced, but here we have good transitions and unexpected power during the crucial moments. Additionally, the action scenes themselves were smoothly filmed and accompanied by awesome visuals at times.

Overall, a great film in this universe that opens the door to complex possibilities. The strong character focus sells this film with refreshingly new ways of defeating antagonists and a third act that plunges into powerful and even heartbreaking moments. It was all subtle enough to work without being over the top, and even though more could have been done, this is a movie I will not soon forget. A near masterpiece in the superhero genre that took on new narrative grounds with high quality results.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Believe The Hype.,"12/28/2021: To me, it was Into The Spiderverse, the live version. I left the theater feeling something strange that I haven't felt in a while after exiting a movie theater: Joy, excitement, happiness, and satisfaction. No preachy annoying character, no grandstanding speech and no politics. This is my first time seeing Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I grew up on Toby Mcguire's Spider-Man and saw the second Andrew Garfield movie. I wasn't a fan of Garfield as Spider-Man in his film, but I absolutely loved him in this movie. You could see his redemption arc coming, but it still hits you in your heart. This movie strikes a balanced tone and the emotional moments paid off because I cared about every single character. The villains were incredible! Willem Dafoe steals every scene he's in and deserves award consideration. The scene where the Green Goblin stops Tom Holland's Peter Parker's plan to save the villains by erasing their powers was so intense, I think I stopped breathing. Doctor Strange was brutally true that one's fate is their fate and Aunt Mae paid the ultimate price because Spider-Man ignored that fact. Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland have great chemistry! Thank you to the screenplay writers and cast for giving the fans an unforgettable Spider-Man experience. All three of the Spider-Man actors sharing scenes was surreal. It was a wild, action-packed, well-acted, well-directed experience with a well-earned bittersweet ending, and the Doctor Strange visual effects were amazing. Watching the villains disappear as Doctor Strange's spell-to-erase-Spiderman-from-memories unfolds and watching Spider-Man say his goodbyes was heartbreaking. What a cinematic experience! Now, I must see every Tom Holland Spider-Man film past and future.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,"Amazing for the fan service, not so much for the film making","A pretty good ending of the trilogy. Spider-Man: No Way Home is in no way an amazing movie but does have aspects to it. Initially, after watching this film, I think everyone was just amazed by what they had witnessed and were over-joyed by what Marvel had given them. However, this movie is a messy mix of okay storytelling and fan service. Jon Watts definitely improved on his former movies with this film, but it was not a great film as it's made out to be.

This film begins with an entertaining sequence in which Peter and MJ are swinging around New York to get away from the angry population which accuse Peter of killing Mysterio. However, this sequence slowly builds into a boring first 30 minutes of the story with the only thing to keep you entertained being the appearance of Charlie Cox's, Matt Murdock. This is a really cheap way to keep the audience entertained while watching. I'm not going to lie, I loved this movie when it came out for these reasons however now I looks back, fan service doesn't make a movie.

After these first 30 minutes you finally get introduced to the first 'villain' of the film being Dr Octavius. This fight scene in particular is just fine, not a standout though. It was also over fairly quick with nothing really entertaining about it. My favourite fight of the film was at Happy Hogan's apartment. It was very entertaining with great choreography and some really interesting elements. They added emotion in this scene incredibly with Aunt May's death which created a really interesting dynamic for such an innocent Peter Parker to follow.

After this scene we get the fan service we were all waiting for which was Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield making an appearance. It was also very entertaining to watch all 3 of the Spider-Men work and fight together but the final fight felt a bit too rushed in how it did things until Peter was fighting the Green Goblin. This very final fist fight between them was very well done, it carried the emotion well and led into a good ending to the film.

Overall, I think Jon Watts created the best film of the trilogy here but there was a lot that could've been improved. Extremely Entertaining to watch but just filled with fan service and no real developed plot.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Phenomenal,This movie was for all gens old and new. It's marvels dark knight. William defo was phenomenal it shows us he still gots it . Andrew got a big pop in the theater and Toby got grown men crying . The ending was way too long but it was good. I suggest seeing this more than once if ur a marvel fan.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,Really sorry but I did NOT enjoy this!,"A plot based upon the main character's stupidity is not entertaining no matter how good the fight sequences or how beautifully it ties up loose ends.

The ending was admittedly strong but getting there was a huge slog. The movie has two huge flaws: First, there is way too much extraneous material crammed in which adds nothing to the plot. (Would someone please explain to me what the whole police interrogation sequence has to do with anything?) Second, the main factor driving the story forward is Peter Parker screwing things up. If he had acted with a little common sense the whole movie would have wrapped up in 30 minutes. (At one point, Dr. Strange even points this out to him.)",Spider-Man: No Way Home

9.0,"More Notable Nine, Than Sinister Six","This Spiderman film arrives with a level of hype previous only given to the ""Avengers"" entries in the MCU. Could it possibly live up to that gargantuan level of anticipation? Do you know, I think it just about does.

With his secret identity revealed to the world, and accused of murder, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone in the world forget who he is. When the spell is interrupted several new villains appear in New York, each confused as to where they are, but with a focus on revenge against Spider-man. As the rifts in the multiverse worsen, Strange arrives at a plan to close the breaches but the cost is too much for Parker, who desperately searches for another way.

I've been watching Marvel films for a long time, before the MCU was even a glint in Kevin Feige's eye, so it's perhaps understanding that I found this to be one of the most emotional films that the series has ever produced. Seeing Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Hayden Church return as their respective characters was pretty affecting, particularly with the way this film continues the character arcs for some of them. To say that all of the performances, effects and cinematography was excellent is an understatement, but also is standard of the work that Marvel and Sony usually provide.

What's not always so spot on is the story. Here though, it's the movies key strength. The objectives are kept relatively straight forward, so it makes a film that has so many characters and plot points in it, is easy to keep up with. There are a few highly emotional moments, both obvious and more subtle and I'm not sure I've ever been with a live audience and heard them audible gasp as loudly as they did at one point in the film.

Last word. Can I just say a well done to Jon Watts. Sony and Marvel, Pascal and Feige usually land most of the plaudits - but he's brought in a trilogy of three great Spiderman films, in five years, and with a global pandemic hampering one of them. Absolutely can't wait for his ""Fantastic four"" film.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,A love letter for spider-man,"Maybe the previous installments of the Spider-Man of the MCU were somewhat disappointing due to the dependence of the arachnid on other characters like Iron Man or ... Iron Man, something which this installment tries in its own way to fix.

The story and the acting feel more solid, actually I don't remember getting so emotional about a spider-man movie before.

The villains of the previous versions of the friendly neighbor are back, and how could it be otherwise they steal the show, it is incredible to see them interact, it is awesome the fact that we learn a little more about them and how some of them relate with each other.

There are an infinity of references to the previous installments, each character that returns, has their moment of nostalgia, as well as there is a bit of a lot of fan service.

There were many expectations but he easily manages to meet them, it is not perfect, but in the end it feels like the only spider-man movie of the MCU made with love, the ending despite being satisfactory, much in fact, still leaves many doubts, I'm excited for what's next for this character.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,It's the best spiderman movie ever made,"Marvel's comic universe has been releasing a pack of movies/series over the last several years back to back, cramming every available platform to keep all kinds of audiences thoroughly engaged with its emphatic content. There is no time to rest if you are an ardent follower. One must learn to adapt to embrace caprice in the content and the characters playing them.

While the past ten years have given us a glimpse into a flurry of new characters in the Marvels space, some of the existing ones have traversed through multi-verse packing alarming delirium.

For instance, spiderman and I believe all of you would agree with me when I say that this is the only character from the comic world that has been deputed to hold its identity through several avatars in the space of two decades. We had a lot of actors playing spiderman before that too, but we will keep it specific to the modern-day rendering of the wall-crawler or famously known as web-slinger. And somewhere during this entire period, I thought marvel had played amiss with the idea of spiderman hopping without putting a viable end to the story of the actors playing it in different times. I mean, Why was Tobey's spiderman had to relinquish the summoned advantage in favor of gliding his storyline into obscurity? Or why was Andrew Garfield introduced and suddenly taken away until Tom Holland lobbed it out of the park with his rendition? Of course, age is a visible factor that cannot be ignored because every grain of spiderman's character bears a constitution of a teenager, and any actor that couldn't fulfill physically must bow out at the right time.

I was moved by this gigantic error of casting and recasting lacking suitable or functional disposition tending to a vast amount of vacuum without proper explanation. Rebooting always comes with emotional baggage for me as an audience. The performance of yesteryear always influences my experience watching spiderman jump from building to building. The bigger question was, would we ever have a chance to go back and watch Tobey and Andrew play our favorite comic character.

Until, of course, spiderman no way home happened. The movie opens up with Peter visibly shaken by the unprecedented attention from the earthlings after his real identity is exposed by Rey Mysterio in the aftermath of the last installment. A compelling question that slinks back on his mind is to somehow watch the world forget about him. He seeks Doctor strange's help to cast a spell that will rewrite his identity, which roundly opens the path to parallel universes, aka multi-verse, after the magic goes horribly wrong. Mighty villains from previous franchises find their way back to exact revenge on their Peter Parker responsible for inflicting an excruciating hurt during their heydays. When the truth about their death dawns on the gang, fog surrounding the multi-verse concept further deepens. The screenplay tactfully handles and articulates the key components that any further pondering of the subject doesn't project it far-fetched from reality. Well, in the manner of speaking.

Unlike the previous 2 installments, the movie conveniently parks itself in a parking lot that faces dense mist of dark overtones vis-a-vis the lighter theme of the last two. Tom Holland leads the overbearing emotional trip that oscillates between reels of notable witty dialogues and despair of unprecedented loss that ably relies on the support from other cast members. Except for Doctor Strange, whose depiction of a character that remains unfazed by the goings-on in the most recent universe lends a balance to emotional symmetry.

Every time the plot introduced the famous villains from the past universes, a shockingly quiet crowd in the movie hall blared up the gloomy walls of the theatre with uncomprehending strain on their lungs. It was a fitting reminder that history does repeat itself, and it comes with a cry of its own. In their typical erstwhile rendering, where they caused mayhem and chaos obliterating anything and everything in their path, the movie does a brilliant job in assembling their destructive escapades. Of course, this was nothing compared to when the spidermen from the last two universes are sucked into the middle of unrelenting disarray by a spell gone wrong once again. I sense a pattern here. Anyway, when Tobey casually walks through the portal from another world dressed as a commoner, the unbridled yelling nearly drowned out the accompanying dialogue exchange. At which point, I sorely wept at the hair loss inside my eardrum. Here is a bristle that would never grow back.

Watching the three spidermen stand next to each other, here is a sentence I never thought I would ever use in my lifetime. But it does make me sound oafish for attempting to paint a decent picture that no impeccable brush strokes would be able to conceive if not for observing the trio on the big screen. It was like a dying wish fulfilled for watching Tobey come back from the throes of anonymity dressed as a spiderman even as a decade and a half have flown by. One would say my review is particularly conspicuous with the absence of any remarks on Andrew, but, the truth be told, his rendering is impressive but not at par with what Tobey did years ago. He holds a special place in our hearts, and no amount of Andrew or Tom's version would spawn an Alzheimer's. I think I got emotional there. In the spirit of the sanctified turf of a wall-crawler, let me bury my petty bias well under my chair and rise above the inconsequential debate. Maybe, that's too political.

Anyway, I am not trying to review the movie by peeling it down piece by piece all the way to the core to single out the imperfections or celebrate the perfections. I am only attempting to relive the experience of watching it on the big screen, just like every other fanboy who follows the Marvels' world like a mad sociopath. In my honest opinion putting aside my fierce loyalty for the franchise, the movie is a treat for the eyes as an independent unit. Compared to the last two, it stands for itself and definitely stands atop the list. Watch it for the performances, a stunning and a quick skim through the characters of parallel universes, and of course, a token gesture of watching the two favorite spidermen from the previous franchise. If you must look beneath the notion of multi-verse, you will actually notice the distinction created by multiple directors working on making their version of spiderman. But the MCU version lets us take a comforting refuge in the knowledge that multi universes do exist, and it takes more than 1 spiderman to come back and remind us of it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,What. a. film.,"The perfect marvel film. Struggling to put into words exactly how awesome this film was. Matching the MCU spider man with the villains of marvel past us just the most ridiculous idea on paper but this next phase of marvel films just pulls it right out of the bag.

10.0,Best Spider-Man film in a long time!!!,"Finally there is a Spider-Man film in the MCU that lives up to the hype!!! The first two film Homecoming and Far From Home were good but not close to the level of Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. The two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield were ok but just didn't connect with me. The two MCU Spider-Man films with Tom Holland were a step in the right direction but also just weren't that memorable. With Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man they went back to a younger, goofier vibe. Both films were very funny but not great superhero films. More comedy than action with some stakes and emotion.

With a sort of messy first act No Way Home finally gave me the Spider-Man film I was waiting for. With what has become a staple of Marvel films it changes from very light and jokey to kind of dark at times. The story is very high concept with what most everybody knows from the trailers are appearances by characters from other Spider-Man films. I was worried that this would be just a gimmick and the characters would be just quick cameos but they are truly part of the story and are all given their moments. Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is good and has a good chemistry with Tom Holland. The relationship between Peter Parker and his girlfriend MJ and Ned are central again here. Both Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are really good in their roles. Tom Holland is finally given a chance to BE Spider-Man. In the other two films he's done he was really good as Peter. Funny and awkward. But also unsure as Spider-Man. This time he really grows into the role and it great to see. The action scenes are really good but the most important thing is that I cared about what was happening on the screen. The fact that so many characters were brought back could have been a disaster but because it's more than just fan service and they are given good screen time it works well. The audience I was watching the film in was really into it. Alot if cheering. I missed that in the last almost 2 years. Watching a big blockbuster in a full theater. It was fun.

The last couple of Marvel films haven't been that good. With Spider-Man: No Way Home Marvel gets back on track. In my opinion it is up there with the better MCU entries.

Grade: A-",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Best Spider-Man movie!,"This is definitely a spider man movie that just can't be topped. There is so much that is great about the movie.

2.0,So Bad Nearly Walked Out #YawnFest.,"WOW What a disappointment love superhero films and have watched them since a child so really looked forward to this. Started off quite good though a bit slow but I'm thinking that's fine they are building up to the action and then 2 hours later I'm like where is the action. Honestly this whole film is so pathetic it is 95% of the kids talking wishy washy ohh I love you ohh I love you more all about feelings and emotions ITS PATHETIC.

Obvious note that they have something against him wearing a mask now this is so you can connect with him as a person I suppose more weakness just completely utterly SUCKS if I wasn't waiting for my wife watching another film I would have walked out.

Utter utter pathetic weak snowflake garbage massive shame as there could have been a great 1hour 30 mins action film here with a superhero doing superhero stuff not going round checking on peoples emotions. The food needs to open a can of Man Up and made a note to never watch another film made by this weak Director. It's a Boo from me.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

It was a truly amazing fan moment to see my childhood Spideys back on the big screen!! The dynamic between Tom, Tobey, and Andrew is unparalleled. This has become my all time favorite Marvel movie EVER!!! I fear nothing will be able to live up to this for me. Don't get me wrong, Marvel has done an excellent job, as always. Especially with Phase 4, but I think it will be very hard to top this one. I would give this 20/10 stars if I could! PLEASE GO WATCH THIS!! IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!

I've been watching these movies for years now and oh that nostalgia hit goood. I had on an ear-to-ear smile and felt so proud watching it. It lives up to expectations. If you haven't been following up, you've got a lot to catch up on, there are some great recapped YT videos if you are short on time. I can't put it on paper, so YKIYK.

10.0,THE BEST ONE...YET!!!,"This is my number one favorite Spider man movie, yet. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but after having seen it, I've been on a high ever since. I seriously want to buy another movie ticket and view it again. I'm the type of person that would avoid spoilers and not watch movie trailers (bcos watching trailers is kinda like a spoiler to me, hope ya'll get that haha). So I went in blind, not having seen the trailer to this movie. I had seen a few photo's here and there so I knew who was going to appear and so on... Even then, whilst watching the movie, they had managed to not inform us of everyone that was going to appear, and I loved that!!

If you are a massive MCU fan and have watched every movie and TV show they've released and you have had a joyful cry afterwards, this is going to knock your socks off.

If you are just looking for a great action movie to watch in the cinemas, after going through lockdown and the variants, so ya'll just wanna have a good time, this move is for you...

If you are a MASSIVE SpiderMan fan, and have seen the Tobey Maguire ones and the Andrew Garfield ones this one is going to take y'all on a rollercoaster of emotions. I'm a fan, and this rollercoaster went from clapping and cheering, to tearing and sobbing, to aweing and gasping, just the perfect combo for this kind of movie.

From start to finish it had me at the edge of my seat! I didn't think a movie could unlock so many emotions at once. 10/10 and by far the best Spider-Man to be made. Toms acting to Aunt Mays death was easily one of the best death scenes shot in the MCU. Andrew and Tobey both were so amazing, Although I do feel like Andrew stole the show. Such an emotional rollercoaster watching all 3 spidermen remise losing their loved ones and to top it off Andrew saving MJ where he could finally forgive himself after Gwen was just the icing on the cake. William Dafoe is hands down the greatest Spider-Man villain and with his calibre of acting he knows what it takes to bring out the ultimate evil mastermind.

7.0,Don't believe the hype,"It's a Marvel movie. Just another Marvel movie with some good bits and some bad ones.

6.0,"Not the best of the series, predictable and nullifies a lot at the same time","I get the story, but too bad it was pretty much a total rip-off out of ""Into the Spider verse"", in essence.

Good action and all that, but dang. I found this sort of disappointing in the end.

While watching it you don't know what's going to happen, so you sit there and try to explore what's happening and all that, but when it's over you're kind of relieved that it is. This is apparently a prelude to the next Dr. Strange-movie, so it wasn't a total waste of time.

No, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, but it did feel a bit out-of-place, especially since you've (presumably) already seen the ""Into the Spider verse"".

But, what really gets me is that some of the end-results of the outcome, without revealing too much, is that it kind of shreds the previous movies (all three previous remakes) and does leave existential questions, like which version could be considered from this reality/universe/dimension/time etc...

If either didn't/doesn't exist the whole Marvel franchise is out the window, or at least most of the movies does share some connections.

What happened to the Stark inheritance? Happy's relation to Spider-man Peter Parker - That leave a lot of questions unanswered in my book.

I haven't picked up a comic book in probably almost 3 decades now, so I don't know much what happened to aunt May since then, but back then I can't recall anything happening to her other than perhaps some sinister bad guys targeting her, but with a positive outcome.

That should also count as what happens in the comic books should reflect on ""our"" multiverse-version of Spider-man, thus what major events happens in those should correspond with the movie. Not quite buying that outcome with aunt May's destiny.

I will watch this movie again, that I'm sure of, as well as the rest of the other Marvel movies, maybe I can puzzle together some more answers, probably more questions too.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,A MASSIVE treat for every Spidey fan out there.,"This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,"Spider-Man: No Way Home. Nostalgia, Fun & Contridictions.","I throughly enjoyed this movie. And I'm clearly not the only one. At the end of the day its a mind-blowing spectacle. But a brilliant spectacle and a brilliant movie are two different things. Take another MCU movie for example; Avengers: Endgame. This is a good movie. It's better than No Way Home for sure. But overall, it's not as good as it could (and maybe should) have been. Granted, its an amazing send-off for the Avengers and a great spectacle but as I look back on it it's predecessor is far superior. Something along those lines applies to No Way Home. But unlike NWH, Endgame is still a good movie. This, not so much.

Part of the reason why this movie failed so heavily in my eyes, is largely down to just how contridictory it is. And this goes all the way back to 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming. Because it is an objective fact that Tom Holland's Peter Parker has already learned that with great power comes great responsibility. The reason this wasn't shown directly might be because the Spider-Man origin is a tired story. Now, don't get me wrong, it's a very good story. No one would have minded all that much if Homecoming had been a re-hash of that tried and tested formula. But realistically, it was time to take the character in a new direction.

But Peter did learn something in Homecoming. In his confrontation with Tony after nearly causing the death of over a hundred people on the ferry. He learned that if you try to take on too much responsibility and in doing so you harm others you almost become selfish. But clearly, in between then and now, Parker has suffered from amnesia because he completely disregards that in this film.

Now, I've heard the argument that Peter is 'just being naive due to his age' and that's why he acts how he acts in this movie. That would hold up, if it weren't for the other movie in Tom Holland's Spider-Man trilogy; Far From Home. After the events of FFH (which occur just a few days before NWH) Peter is not being naive, he's being stupid. In Far From Home, Peter meets Quentin Beck, a man who spends a significant portion of the movie gaining Peter's trust only to break it completely. You would think that after this ordeal, our friendly-neighbourhood Spider-Man would have some serious trust issues, but clearly not! In FFH he learned not to trust strangers but that is the *third* lesson that is disregarded in this film.

And here we are at plot hole No. 4, Aunt May's lesson to Peter about taking responsibility is a living, breathing contridiction of itself. I don't like it when my reveiws cross over into spoiler territory so I'm going to dance around the actual details but I'm guessing the majority of the people reading this have already watched the film so you'll understand what I'm talking about. Aunt May gives her amazing insight to Peter and futher on in the movie, tradegy strikes and disproves her point completely. I rest my case.

I don't wish to reiterate what I've already said, so I'll make this short. On the tip of the No Way Home iceberg, there is awesome spectacle. But beneath the surface is a beheamoth of bad writing, plot holes and, of course, contridictions. I hope in a few years time, people will look back at this film with a more critical eye. But until then, please don't hate on me for this.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Goos,"There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.

It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.

Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.

And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.

That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.

It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.

As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.

If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,Nonsense And Nostalgia,"Review By Kamal K

I don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.

And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.

Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.

Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

6.0,Fan Service Done Well,"This is one giant nostalgia hit injected straight into your eyes thanks to Sony.

They knew what they were doing here.

They knew how many of us loved the original Spider-Man films and they knew how many people love the new Spider-Man.

They also knew that those fans are somewhat divided.

How do we get the old fans to like our newer and worker series? We do what we did with Star Wars... We bring back the most loved characters.

And it worked!

The script isn't out of this world good but it's enough. Willem Dafoe does a tremendous job reprising his role of The Green Goblin and is the most outstanding of the older villains. Jamie Foxx's Electro wasn't all that. The character was boring in The Amazing Spider-Man and he didn't really deliver here either.

The combat was decent, the surprises were done really well and the story wasn't completely awful.

Mary Jane still sucks but her performance was the best she has done. Basically, she wasn't an insufferable, woke fun sucker for the first time ever.

Still wouldn't mind if she got the old Gwen Stacey treatment, if you know what I mean.

Aunt May is also boring and beyond dumb in this film. I won't spoil anything. All I'll say is, lives would have been saved if we didn't listen to her, yet the movie acts as if she's so profound and good.

Overall, this is the best a Marvel film can do and the first time I've rated any of them above 5 stars. Don't go in thinking this will be phenomenal. Unless you're a a massive Marvel fan. In which case, this will be the best film you'll ever see according to you.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,Good but overrated,The movie was good but nothing perfect. I was so bored the firsy hour. When Tobey and Andrew showed up i started to enjoy it more. I would like to see a more epic way for Andrew and Tobey's entrance. The script was bad for me. Especially the part where ned can open portals. As i said it was just a good movie. Nothing perfect.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,"Energetic and Colorful, But Also Meandering and Overloaded","Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.

One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.

I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the ""neighborhood"" part of ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man."" Actually, they might've forgotten the ""friendly"" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.

No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.

This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,What a film!,"I've never been into the Marvel much but over Christmas found myself watching the Spider-man's and Avengers and the newest Spider-Man - just wow! Funny, emotional, wild - it had me feeling all the emotions! Great casting, great direction, great cinematography! Go and watch, it's crazy what happens!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,GOOOOOD,"I can hardly be called a metrosexual interested in high fashion, but even I was curious about the tragedy of the Gucci family. The world-famous story of the fall of one of the most famous brands, which is literally synonymous with the word 'wealth', was already ready-made material for the film, it only remained to properly dispose of the material. The film was taken up by none other than maestro Ridley Scott, known for a whole host of cult films (""Alien"" and ""The Fall of the Black Hawk"") and the same mass of equally loud failures (""Robin Hood"" and ""Adviser""). Did he manage to implement such an interesting idea, or is it rather a blunder? It's a shame to say this, the second one is more suitable here.

The main problem of the film is that it is staged without any frills, visual or narrative. There are, of course, chic costumes, but otherwise there is no highlight in the 'Gucci House'. The movie is absolutely bland and offers nothing. A straightforward story unfolds before us, running for two and a half hours and told without any revelations, and which can easily be found freely available on the Internet. Almost no moment of the film really catches, although there are scenes in which it was possible to roam. As an example, Maurizio Gucci, played by Adam Driver, is killed at the very end and it has no dramatic value, because almost everyone who wanted to watch the film knows that he will die. Empathize with the character also will not work, because there is no sympathy for him (we will return to this later). Could it have been done better? Of course! For example, you can start with the murder of Gucci, show part of the events of the film with flashbacks and scenes of the trial of Patricia Gucci (the trial, by the way, was never shown, although the plot here is also very interesting) and then wrap around the death of Maurizio. It would be much more interesting and the effect on the viewer would be much stronger here. But no, the story has remained just a dry retelling of well-known facts.

Another significant disadvantage of the film is the characters. There are practically no complaints about the actors themselves, but the way their characters are shown in the Gucci House is questionable. Firstly, this is Patricia Gucci performed by Lady Gaga. The whole movie is not clear whether she really loves her husband, or just wants to squeeze money from him. And this is hardly done intentionally. It looks as if the screenwriter himself did not fully understand the essence of the hero. It was possible to easily build an intrigue based on the duality of her image, but there is nothing like that here. Secondly, this is Maurizio Gucci played by Adam Driver, who looks like he is an absolutely left-wing character. In reality, a real macho and lovelace here has turned into an insecure, self-doubting nerd, I'm not afraid to say. And everything would be fine, you can assume such a convention, but the problem is that in the second half of the film he abruptly becomes vindictive and angry after the hero has lost faith in Patricia. If Maurizio were the same here as in life, then such a change in the hero could be believed, but in this case such a sudden change of character from quiet and calm to unbalanced looks just ridiculous. About Summer in general, a separate topic. He overplays here so often and his image is so caricatured that it feels as if the hero he presented had escaped from some parody comedy or even a children's cartoon. Only Pacino and Irons were given adequately prescribed characters, although the latter is negligible in the film.

But the biggest disadvantage of local heroes is that there is not a single gram of empathy for any of the heroes. Patricia, as described above, it is unclear what she is. Maurizio is initially presented as an idiot who fell in love with the first person he met, and then an embittered idiot who betrayed his family. Rudolfo (Maurizio's father) is shown as a typical narcissistic rich man. Paolo, in general, is just an unfunny caricature of a typical narrow-minded son. Only Aldo behaved adequately here, and then, by no means always. There is not one hero who would perform the function of an emotional core here and would cause the viewer at least some sympathy. It was possible to make a film about the near-Fonvizin heroes, since some of them are so grotesque here, but then the story should initially be made a satire about rich people who ruined themselves, and not a drama on serious topics. In the end, neither one nor the other really came out.

As a result, we can say that the 'House of Gucci', rather, does not meet the expectations. Such an interesting story could have been realized many times better than it turned out in the end. Yes, this is not a completely lost film and maybe it's worth a look once, but for those who know about the interesting history of this family and those who were impressed by the impressive cast, they will leave the viewing rather disappointed. This is not even close to a pleasant surprise in the face of the 'Last Duel'. Unlike her, this movie is definitely mediocre. Expensive and lush like the Gucci themselves, but still mediocre.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,This movie is INDEED worth the hype!!,"{no spoilers}

Usually, when movies get loads of hype, I personally think they're overrated!

However with this movie, it was not the case!!

100% the best movie of 2021; maybe even the best movie in the last couple of years!

I watched this movie in ScreenX and it definitely made a difference! With this sort of movie, it was so immersive, especially during the action scenes!

I experienced every emotion watching this movie; sadness, shock, happiness, excitement - the list could go on!

I didn't want to leave this cinema, it was that good! I would happily have watched 2 more hours of this film!

What I loved about this movie, was that it wasn't just the acting that was great, but it was everything; the script and story, the VFX, the special effects, the stunts, the music/score, the overall pacing of the movie (it wasn't slow at all!)... and so much more.

For those of you who haven't watched the movie already, you are in for a treat! This movie is AMAZING! It's one of those movies where you wish you could watch it for the first time again!

Last note: I would say that it would be good to have an understanding of the other Spider-Man movies and their stories before watching this movie though!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

5.0,truly mediocre,"Although there is a huge effort during the first half of the movie to distract with a lot of pretty action. Overall there is no plot until maybe midway. And that plot only occurs because characters have to act a lot more stupid than they typically are. One thing that is really disturbing about this version of spider-man is that the character is virtually the same reckless teenager he was at the beginning. Then in the second half there is a pointless sacrifice as part of an attempt to sort of reboot the series, an effort to restart the character back to his beginnings. Seems they were afraid to continue to develop him as was. All of action makes it sort of fun to watch, like an Olympic event, but otherwise it is a pointless superhero movie meaning nothing.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

9.0,Arguably the finest MCU film. Finds that perfect formula between irreverent and intelligent,"I'm not the guy to go to for another cheerleader of the MCU. I've been largely a skeptic on the sustainability of their universe building, and Easter eggs. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is the culmination of that approach, arguably even more so than 'Avengers Endgame'. The universe and rules have been stretched so far that they literally have broken. This is a tough sell. There is nothing more boring to me than a bloated comic book ""epic"" that spends it's entire time winking at the audience. 'No Way Home' was filled with so many potential traps but to my pleasant surprise and delight I think Director Jon Watts masterfully weaves a fun tale that has stakes. Most importantly I think 'No Way Home' is the movie that will please probably the broadest bases of movie and comic book fans that Marvel has ever ever.

I feel it fair to go in with my biases. I love the character of Spider-Man and his rogue gallery. I have not loved the movies save for maybe Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2'. That isn't to say that I didn't like or love elements of the other 'Spider-Man' films. I think Dafoe's Green Goblin in the 2002 original is arguably the finest on screen Marvel villain of all time( in fact 'No Way Home' takes away the arguably). I thought Holland was a great Peter Parker but the previous entries had him merely as an appendage to the Avengers with no real identity or emotion of his own. The Andrew Garfield Spider-Man's, well I couldn't so anything nice about them but I can say nice things about Garfield now...

This is a massive special effects film and all the action sequences hit the targets. But it is the characters and largely the themes that I love. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' does what so many Marvel films cannot. It has it's eyes set on the future in an intriguing way but never does it's universe building come at the expense of the story they are currently telling. This is something that has been an Achilles heal of these comic book films( there is no worse example than Garfields' The Amazing Spider- Man 2')I feel a problem Marvel has and this maybe me being a tad harsh and cynical on the diehards is that the fans are far too forgiving of lazy writing as long as they get those Easter eggs. In the build-up to Thanos it felt like people were forgiving to sit through forty minutes of subpar writing in movies like 'Age of Ultron' or 'Thor: The Dark World' if they could see that little sliver of stone. Well, the expectation for 'No Way Home' was to bring back the legacy characters in a multiverse. If Marvel delivered I think people would have been satisfied. Marvel not only delivered however, they created a story that doesn't work without the concept of legacy. 'No Way Home' gives weight again to the phrase ""With Great Power comes Great Responsibility"" and frankly that was a phrase that had been repeated so much that I was getting a little tired of it.

Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire, and Tom Holland are perfect in the film. The entire story and their dynamic is about heroism. The movie stops to take breaks from it's action for our heroes to grow and support each other. As I said the movie is about legacy and the movie bravely considers that maybe Garfield's and Maguire's iteration of the character made critical mistakes and that their mission is to save Holland and make him a better Spider-Man than even they were. In fact my biggest complaint about the movie is that it seems at it's conclusion it will make a stunningly brave choice in having Dafoe's Goblin kill Maguire's Spider-Man. What an impact that would have had! But they couldn't do it. Feige Sequelitis at work.

My other nitpick is that the humor doesn't always land. The jokes are a little too meta for their own good. MJ and Ned skirt a little too much into self-referential parody and ironically they are making fun of the Raimi pictures and how ""quaint"" they seem in comparison to this. Why? I mean it's ironic that they had to bring back Raimi's universe to give this extra umphf to Holland's.

I digress, 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is a blast and shows that despite some of the traps of the Marvel formula they can make something that builds on all of their strengths.

Footnote: Willem Dafoe's Goblin is a treasure. I can't state this enough.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,My story with Spiderman,"I believe everyone has their own stories and memories about Spiderman. Here's mine. Spiderman (2002) was the first ever superhero film I've ever watched. I've watched the movie countless of time. I've even bought a Spider suit and I was just 5 years old at that time. After almost 20 years and 24 years old now, I've finally seen the best Spiderman movie that ever made.

To some people it might just be an ordinary Marvel's movie but to us, it's more than that.

I watched this movie on the 15th December, the day it released in Malaysia. I've got no expectations although I've seen a lot of rumours everywhere but Marvel dealt with it pretty good. Just hire someone to make a fake clip about the film and the fans is gonna think the rumors is probably fake. Honestly, it's also a pretty good strategy by Marvel as the rumors not only hype up the movie but also make people wanted to watch the film just to confirm whether the rumors is true or not.

Back to the movie, the beginning was fine until 40-50 minutes and I've even forgotten about the rumors while watching the movie until Ned started to make a portal. I didn't expect anything and probably think they're gonna find Tom using that but noooo. It reveals a Spider man with a different suit and then someone in the cinema suddenly started shouting. I was like why?? Is Andrew and Tobey going to appears now? Then the spiderman ran towards the portal and jump in. Still I think it could probably be Tom from other dimension or just some stunt actor. It was until that Spiderman revealed his face. Voilaaaa it's ANDREW GARFIELD!!!! Everyone in the cinema went crazy and just shouting like we've just won World Cup. It was then the tears from my left eyes started falling. It was at that time I saw hope. And then of course there's only Andrew in it and I've seen a rumors saying only Andrew going to be in it so I kept my expectations low. Then Ned started to create another portal. Everyone in the cinema was on their seats. Is it Tobey? Is it Tobey? Then voila!!! TOBEY MAGUIRE!!!!!! The crowd in the cinema just went crazy and it felt like an earthquake!!! At this moment the tears from my right eyes just fell. It sure is a happy tears 😭. I was so happy that all Spiderman is in the movie.

Not only the fans voice was heard but the meme that we've seen all over social medias was in it too. It's like dream comes true for all Spiderman fans out there and it's sooooo freaking satisfying. Seeing 3 Spider-Man swings together was the coolest scene in the entire movie and this movie just changed the way people looked at Andrew Garfield's Spiderman. I'm just glad he managed to save MJ in this universe as he failed to save his Gwen in his universe. I cried on this scene too after looking at Andrew's face who managed to saved MJ. So glad he did it.

Not only that, the reference the movie used is all related to the past Spiderman movies which is not part of Marvel. I know a lot of people hated Sony due to the rights they owned but this time Sony did make a great decision and I bet it will be the best decision Sony ever made because this movie is definitely going down in the history as the best Spiderman movie ever made.

Other than that, there is some lacking in terms of the plot but having Tobey, Andrew and Tom in the same movie is going to make all the fans out there forgets about the flaws. All the fans ever wanted is for their voice to be heard and this is enough because the fans will felt like they are part of it. So yeahhh D *cough* C listen to your fans out there.

Well other than that, watching this film also reminds me of my good childhood memories because 5 years after the first Spider-Man movie was released, my parents broke out and ever since then, I was in depression until now. Watching this movie reminds me how happy and different I was at that time as I was always happy before everything just broke down into pieces. So yeahh, to me this is not just some movie but a key that unlock back my happiest memories.

Thank you Marvel, Sony and the entire production crew for making this movie happened. And this is why, this will be one of the best Marvel's film ever.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Enjoy the entertainment,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is an entertaining movie that largely feeds on nostalgia and characters from the Maguire universe in order to re-tell the classic Spiderman story. However, it is not without its issues.

Once again, Holland's Spiderman is his own worst enemy, consistently making mistakes and causing the main plot to unfold. By the end of the film, he has finally learned from them and accepted responsibility, maturing as a person.

The film's plot holes can be explained away using the multiverse. We haven't learned much about it yet. Hopefully the next Strange film can flesh things out.

I struggled with the pacing at times. My attention waned through the romantic moments between Peter and MJ, mainly because their relationship seemed to be based on teenage awkwardness more than genuine chemistry.

The fight scenes were pretty cool at first, with the Doc Oc, Strange and GG scenes being clear highlights, but as the movie wore on the overload of CGI hit a point where it became a bit of a blur. And can somebody please explain to me why Hollywood is so fascinated with shaky-cam close-ups during 1 on 1 fight scenes? The still moments were great.

Overall, a good movie fueled by nostalgia that probably ran 10-15minutes too long. Now, the question that we're asking: what's next for Spiderman?",Spider-Man: No Way Home

I wasn't the biggest fan of previous two movies. I felt they were to independent and carried the weight of Avengers. Yet they were fun entertainment.

9.0,Something special,"I was honestly moved by this film. Sure the plot was a bit weak and there was some plotarmor in the film (although it don't bother me in way that made me dislike the film). But the respect and genuine hommage to the previous spiderman films was so refreshing. I resent the ubiquitous use of the Disney-formula, the way that a lot of movies and series feel like something made on an assembly line, where all bad things are polished out. But in my opinion, this film tried to keep its predecessors as they were, and it felt genuine. There was real emotion in this film, the pains and hurts of previous Spiderman iterations were not polished away. No, they were there and they were redeemed in a way that I found moving and believable. And there are true consequences of actions in this film. Consequences that that feel and are real within the world Spider man. That is again a break with the formulic way that a lot movies seem to deal with their characters and stories.

The atmosphere at the theater was something else, everyone was yelling and clapping it was wonderful and it is absolutely an experience that i will never forget.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,BEST LIVE ACTION SPIDERMAN FILM AND TOP MCU FILM,"An epic conclusion to the story of spiderman and developing Tom's Peter's Character Arc.

Tom has been portrayed a child in the previous movies which is why i never liked him

But this movie has shown a drastic improvement over his character which was much needed.

Not to say the 3 spideys on one screen.

I literally cried during the Final Fight.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,The Real Spider Man is back!,Watching real spider man after 14 years brought back all the childhood memory .This is must watch for every spider man fan.. And for Marvels please make few more parts with the real spider man i mean with Tobey Maguire he deserves the farwell for what he dose for spider man and marvel.. he took the spider man character and marvel comics to each and every house hold world wide.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Thank You,"What an idea, that led to even more. Cheers.

Edit, my review is too short of characters to submit, so there, and thats that.

Nope still too short - i will now go and watch the first 2 again.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Nostalgic/Forced Play on Spider-Man,"Like a lot of people, I knew that the previous two Spider-Man and their villians will be featured in this movie because of social media. And that the movie centered around the multiverse, and how it was broken open by Strange's Spell in attempt to fulfill Tom's Peter Parker request to make everyone (almost everyone) forget his Spider-Man identity. Still, it was great to see a lot of old faces from my childhood and teenage years. And damn, Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, and Andrew Garfield acting performance were the best parts of the movie. However, the interaction between the characters and the new characters seems forced/unnatural. It almost seem like Aunt May had to die so that the three Spider-Man got something in common (in addition to the quote, "" With great power comes great responsibility."" And somehow they need Michelle Jones to be there in some scenes, and Ned Leeds to have magic. All in all, everything seems forced. My take is that it should be a two part movie, or a mini series for the old and new characters to develop the chemistry. Lastly, why is this movie like top 16 on imdb?",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,S P I D E R - M A N !!!!!!!!,"I was lucky enough to score an invite to the South Australian premiere of the film and to then see the midnight screening of the film upon its release.

To me, this film is a perfect super-hero movie, but more so the perfect spider-man movie that pays tribute and is quite essentially an ode to all things that came before it.

This is is most certainly Tom's best outing as Spidey. He experienced an abundance of emotions, all while learning how to control them and be the best version of himself that he can be, because you know, ""with great power comes great responsibility"".

The ensemble cast work together like no other, the humour is beyond incredible and the visuals are absolutely stunning, backed up with an amazing score also.

There's not much that can be said without spoiling the movie however, this movie is not one to be missed.

An AMAZING conclusion to the homecoming trilogy. A must watch.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A handshake through time...,"I step into a room, simultaneously so do a 6 year old, 12 year old, and now 20 year old me. We extend our hands for a three-way hand shake, nod and walk out. The energy present in that silent interaction is this movie. I have watched every Spider-Man movie growing up and just like every other kid, I wanted to be him. To be something bigger than myself. That seems to be what marvel movie now stand for, to be bigger. This movie reemerged that feeling in me once again. It also gave me the drive for something else that few films have achieved, to become an actor. Being a part of creating something which inspires people like me. No way home brought elements of beautiful writing, acting, and cinematography that just wasn't quite there in the first 2 (still great movies). The movie has the heart felt tragedy that just pulls us so much closer to Peter Parker as a human and Spider-Man as a hero. I could barely contain my excitement whilst in my seat do to being totally gripped by the story. A beautiful production all around. It's the perfect way to have ended your year or started off the new one. I know we all walked out wanting to be a part of that multi-dimensional hug.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Awesome Movie!!,"Great movie. The theatre experience - our audience started cheering when Andrew Garfield showed up, then absolutely lost our minds when Toby came on screen.

Extreme Nitpicks (and the reason why this is not a a 10) - didnt care for the whole Spiderman learning the mirror dimension in 5 seconds, and trapping one of the most powerful people in there. Aunt May did NOT need to die. And the bad guys couldve just been bad the whole time then saved at the end. Rather than bad, then pretend to be good, then bad, then good again. But it did let Jaime Fox provide some brilliant lines. But like i said, these are EXTEME nitpicks.

As for the ""pros"" there are too many. Friggin Andrew Garfields acting chops is one of the best in our day. Toby's on-screen presence felt as comforting as Steve from Blue's Clues. LOL. Great movie!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
,Spider-Man no way home more like no way I'm bored,I want to prefaces I did not see the movie. But it was a dull three hour drab I would've much rather been sitting at home not watching this movie.

I can't decide how much should i give you with any spoilers, so I'm not gonna discuss what you gonna get in this one all i can say is it's worth every single penny you gonna spend if you gonna watch in theatre, we all became fan of Spiderman as children ""no way home"" is the kind of movie when you gonna shout like that same kid one more time.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,"Mind Blown, Watch with Fans!!!","The hype is real! I enjoyed every aspect of this film because everything I would never imagine happening in the cinematic Marvel universe occurred in this film.

Let us focus on the setup. For over a year, I grew in anticipation of how the world would react to discovering Spider-Man's true identity. And let's just say the film depicted this well. The drama and domino effect of learning Spider-man's identity caused an influx of intentional and emotional scenes that immersed me in the movie. This film had many scenes highlighting the complexities and beauty of being Spider-Man's. We grew up watching different universes, yet having them come together felt blissful. With various comical scenes, more specifically the scene towards the end with all three Spider-Man engaging in a long yet necessary dialogue about being ""amazing"" or web fluid added to the overall appeal. With these ""easter eggs"" scenes, it's clear to see this film is the definition of Spider-Man pop culture. For my Spider-man Marvel fans, there is a lot to unpack., there are many hints towards potential future projects such as Miles Morales, and foreshadowing for Ned, just to name a few. The film does a terrific job incorporating spider man memes, intentionally accumulating possibilities and what we want as fans. Because everything seems to affect the Marvel universe.

On the other hand, this film incorporated a lot of emotion. Reliving the traumas the previous Spider-Man's faced in conjunction with fresh wounds. I felt as if I experienced everything they felt. And the crazy part is that it is just the tip of the iceberg. We haven't experienced Tom Holland's Spider-Man transform his jolly teen apparatus until this film. The darkness that occurred was necessary for us to see the range of this Marvel Universe Spider-Man.

Additionally, it is important to note how spot on his character is, focusing on the wrong things, letting emotion overshadow his judgment. Some of the things he says make you remember he is only 17 years old in the film. This film allowed us to reminisce on Spider-Man we grew up with while also growing with the current one.

Verdict: Spider-Man No Way Home swings in for a home run! This film had a great mixture of nostalgia, action, iconic scenes, Easter eggs( in dialogue included), Marvel characters, drama, comedy, love, and growth. It is tough to say a film is perfect. Yet, given its complexities and delivery, maybe even the appeal of seeing this opening night, this is by far one of the best Marvel films.

Does this take me to paradise: Absolutely!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

I watched it twice in the first 2 days and watching it the second time I didnt enjoy it any less or wasn't any less excited, Tom Holland played an incredible role and the whole film was amazing.

Spoiler bit: Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were 2 additions the whole world wanted and their parts were played to perfection, Aunt May dying added a really dark twist to the film and it set the rest of the movie up perfectly.

Brilliant storytelling, pulled at the heartstrings... Andrew Garfield knows what I'm talking about!

8.0,Great Collaboration But rehashing other stories,"Make no mistake I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, My problem was that it didn't really seem more spider man movie as opposed to just more spider Men ,bringing back villains from all the other movies seems like a great Call back but you ascribe it a lack of imagination and you know trying to point out that this Peter Parker has a better heart than the rest.

7.0,It's back to the beginning of Spiderman.,"I have been a fan of almost all marvel movies but this was just not good. It feels like one of the earliest Spiderman movies and I left the cinema after 90 minutes of nonstop nobrain action that was just a piece of crap storyline. I guess I'm to old for these kind of movies. Marvel usually have great backstorys and I had big expectations when the movie had 9.0 on imdb.

9.0,The most amazing Spiderman.,"I'm not going to lie, having heard so many great things about this film made me a little dissapointed during the first hour of this film. Sure, it was enjoyable but I was expecting something spectacular waiting anxiously on the edge of my seat. But, in the end i was so far from dissapointed. This movie truly has everything a good ""superhero"" movie can have. Lots of great friendship and love scenes, fight scenes and those really, really intense scenes. But the thing that makes this movie stand out the most is because spiderman carries the sense of humanity. This movie made me cry, laugh, irritated and even a little bit angry sometimes and that's what makes it so great. The emotions made it the best spiderman movie so far. One moment that really made me cry was when Garfield (spiderman 3) catches MJ, not wanting Holland (spiderman 1) to feel the same sorrow he felt for Gwen. I also feel like you get the most out of this movie if you've watched all of the spiderman movies made, it gets you really sentimental.

If you haven't seen this movie yet then you really have to as soon as you can, one of the best movies i've seen this year.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,This one gets it right!,"It's been a while since I reviewed a movie I saw at the Cinema but this one had to get my review. Loved Spider-Man since I was about 5 or 6 & that's a long 44 years of being a fan. Maguire's films were okay with 2 being the better one. Garfield's first was stellar with a darker tone & two far better leads but second was over long & a badly written Electro. Harry & his Goblin were impressive. While I enjoyed Holland's 2 films, (loved him in Civil War too) I thought they felt a little commercial & lacking the darker tone of Garfield's. No Way Home has an absolutely AMAZING cast with a really first rate storyline. While the film is long, it is very engaging. Dafoe was unreal as Osbourne, bringing many surprises. Molina was his usual outstanding self as Ock. Foxx was fantastic as Electro and Ifans was impressive as his slimy alter ego, The Lizard. Maguire & Garfield were an absolute delight, I feel as though they were very happy to don the costumes again. This is a movie I will see again in the Cinema. The last time I attended a film twice was Star trek VI The Undiscovered Country in 1991.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,They nailed it!!,"The film manages to handle with care and elegancy almost all of its cast. Good dialogue and great action scenes across the board. Willem Dafoe was a real show stealer, though acting was stellar from everyone involved.

The only thing I would criticise is the whole premise of the multiverse and how it occured. Dr Strange would never cast such dangerous spell and Peter getting in the way and messing it up like that felt kinda weird. But I guess the movie had to happen somehow.

9/10 from me. A must watch for all superhero/comic book fans for sure.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Made me cry more than once,"After so much anticipation and fear of it being spoiled, I finally got my viewing of the latest movie.

So much happened and the way the story flowed was great. Lots of action, good emotional moments and that ending.

Knowing there will be three more coming from Sony is exciting to see where the adventure goes next.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Spider-Man: No Way Home review,"Spider-man no way home was one of the most expected movies of the year and with releasing newer trailer audiences' expectations increased. Personally, I don't like multiverse or parallel universe concepts but after I saw Spider-man: into the spider-verse then I thought this concept can fit to a live action spider-man movie.

Let's get back to the movie, Spider-man no way home easily gonna please most Spider-man lovers as we see from the trailers different villains from various spider-man movies is enough reason for that. The movie achieves to connect nostalgia and freshness at the same time while doing this rewards the fans who have seen previous Spider-man movies released since 2000s.

While the movie was bringing different characters together from different spider-man movies, it improves some characters for example Electro's characterization is much more convincing than his characterization from the amazing spider-man 2. Spider-man No way home has darker a tone than 2 previous MCU movies and this condition contributes to this movie positively. Now I must mention things that could be better in the movie.

Firstly, Dr. Strange's characterization was so passive and we know that he is so much powerful than his depiction in this movie. While some Villains are improved as it was mentioned above Electro's characterization improved significantly in this movie but not every character's characterization has improved the same way Electro's characterization improved. Some of them don't have so much screen time or effect like the Lizard. Since there are variety of characters this condition is understandable but it could have been improved.

Another thing is not so good in this movie are the fight scenes. The fight scenes were so cartoonish even though I saw the movie on IMAX, they were so forgettable. I have seen the movie a few days ago but I already have forgotten all of the fight scenes even the Raimi's spider-man 3 had some better fight scenes than this movie. Briefly, Spider-man no way home is the best MCU spider-man movie and it is a good fan service furthermore one of the best movies I have seen this year so far. Everyman who knows Spider-man character must see it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,What a movie,"Amazing, Beautiful, Superb Action, Smooth VFX, Amazing Action. Its once in a lifetime experience watching this movie in IMAx Hands down Its The best Spiderman movie and one of the best superhero movie of all time. Period.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Could watch again for the notalgia,"The plot was solid, but I think the whole reason why everything happened was weak. Although, movie does justify why the main character caused everything in the first place. A lot of jokes, but I think it hurts the movie since I felt could not take it very seriously, specially in the sad scenes. Maybe if the movie's comedy had been tone down a little bit, that would have helped. A lot of fan service which was nice, but you probably will need to see all other Spiderman movies to fully enjoy which is what? Six? Eight (if do watch the MCU spiderman movies)? Maybe more if you consider Avengers. The acting was nice and relatable. It is amazing there such a big casts in this movie.

This Spiderman movie was solid, I would watch it again for the nostalgia of seeing my friendly neighbor Spiderboy.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Review,"Amber herd is shown tilting over to sip water from the kitchen sink. On the way down to a river of slaving away people, Herd reaches her arm into a fish tank full of tictaks and pulls out a 33 lenze pair of sunglasses. The film moves to a scene with a spider, termite, and hampster all having lunch in the cafeteria; And they see herd walking by. They spider and termite scamperd on after herd and eventually joined a large crowd of people watching herd doing the splits in front of a church. The hampster had stayed back and we saw him open his breifcase and stare at the contents (about 3lbs of silver with a horse drawn into it). Im not sure what that signified. Later we see the hampster smoking a long cigarette rolled from a piece of notebook paper, he also breakes a glowing cain on a usps mailbox (i didnt get it). Better stick with one of the good ones folks, like Rambo. A simple story about an office cop dealing with a Detroit hangover. They dont put movies together like that anymore. If youre 90 years old (like me) just watch Rambo and get your cat fead.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Very Fun Movie,"I enjoyed this from start to finish. Definitely can see myself watching it many times over in the future.

I was blown away in the theater. The roaring crowd brought me back to what it felt like watching Endgame opening nights. Definitely a very rare experience that only Marvel has seemed to pull off since 1977's Star Wars. So that in itself is very admirable.

Though I rate this film a 10/10 for the experience I had in the theater, I'm not going to rate the film itself on the adrenaline rush built up by an enthusiastic crowd. I'm taking a big step back and judging the story itself here. I'd give this a 7.5/10 (IMDb doesn't allow decimal increments lol). Far far farrr from bad but also not quite Oscar-worthy.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Good but the movie is overrated my opinion:(7.4/10),"Analysis -Good start (It was a little cheesy) -Good action and budget (Nothing amazing but I loved the CGI for sandman a lot!!) -Good drama (It felt long and dragged out at parts and had some weird plot lines) -Loved the nostalgic feeling of having all Spider-Man's back -The movie was very underwhelming which made the rating for it much lower then it could have been.

-Decent pacing -Emotional ending (the ending was the best part of the movie. (The last 25 minutes)",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,Iconic spiderman movie,"This movie is one of the best spiderman movies. The beginning to the middle of the film is pretty boring, but the scenes and scenes after that are iconic! This spiderman movie is helped by all the characters that appear in each scene! It brings back childhood memory! The reason why i didn't give this a 9 or 10 is because i quite hate the peter parker's tom holland character here, because i don't know some of the scenes he plays in this movie are a bit confusing and the portrayal of him playing clumsy characters is not suits for spidey character in marvel, but overall a really good movie! Good work!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY!,"*SPOILER FREE*

WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY

Being a long time MCU fan since its inception and a Spidey fan. There is not denying the fact that, It's the best Spidey movie to date, Tom Holland absolutely crushes the role with his strength and heart. It's his best Spidey movie and by far my favorite marvel movie after Endgame and IW.

Doctor Strange, Ned and MJ, Aunt May, and Happy all are a delight to see and watch. John Watts has absolutely brought out his top game for marvel fans and made the movie exciting for them in ways that we seriously could not even fathom. The fan moments are INSANE!!! And the call banks to memes are hilarious and heartwarming.

The action sequences are amazing with Doctor Strange and Spiderman sharing some of the best stuff together. Doctor Strange is also amazing and now kind of the main focus of the MCU. This movie gave me tears, excitement, adrenaline, and had me jumping off my seat and cheering in happiness several times. Just amazing from start to finish. The ending is satisfactory and heartwarming just as was required. Go watch this movie as soon as you can and get hitched with Tom Holland.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,the level of stupidity is astounding,The only good thing about this movie is the visual affects. I wasted 2.5 hours watching this. I was really waiting for something exceptional based on the reviews this movie got. But in reality it is worse than matrix resurrections.,Spider-Man: No Way Home

8.0,An excellent and well-thought-out cash-in on 20 years of Spider-Man nostalgia.,"First off, if you haven't seen this movie yet, I want to warn you that there are spoilers in this review. There's no way I can talk about this movie freely without divulging key plot points. With this out of the way, I want to recognize that nostalgia played a big part in the hype for this third entry in the Tom Holland Spider-Man series. No Way Home is the kind of film that I figured could never be made due to all the different rights needed (much like Ready Player One (2018) and all its nerdy references). That Marvel and Sony pulled this off is testament to their ability to make the impossible happen.

I was glad that this latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise forewent the ""origin story"" in Homecoming (2017). Little did I know, they'd pull the same trick that Skyfall (2012) did with the James Bond franchise by putting the origin story in the third film. However, No Way Home had a lot of baggage to carry from the previous Spider-Man movies that either fizzled out or failed to be made. Bringing back villains from these previous entries was a genius move, even if it didn't fully complete the ""Sinister Six"" grouping that fans would have liked.

With Marvel's introduction of the multiverse into their cinematic canon, they primed No Way Home to bring all three Spider-Men together to find the redemption they failed to obtain in their respective series. Unfortunately, the one reason I have to take a star away from my review of this movie is that they spend far too much time merely wallowing in nostalgic references. Like, I get it, these Spider-Men want to show how their experiences match, but when they're literally spending minutes on screen just quipping back-and-forth moments from the previous movies, it got me rolling my eyes and waiting for it to end. Ultimately, though, this was a strong demarcation for the Tom Holland era of the franchise, and a great action-filled movie as well.

An excellent and well-thought-out cash-in on 20 years of Spider-Man nostalgia, I give Spider-Man: No Way Home 4.0 stars out of 5.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Classic Marvel Mayhem,"Tom, Zendaya, and Jacob are amazing as always. Benedict seems a bit off, unfortunately there was never an explanation about why he was so careless, but he wasn't in it a ton so it's not a huge deal. The villains from previous movies are awesome, plenty of references to previous movies. Tobey is great and Andrew is AMAZING. Overall, another win from Marvel.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,By Far The Best Spider-Man MCU Film,"Oh...my...God! Not only did this movie broke me, it delivered! I was skeptical about the whole Multiverse story, heard all the rumors and thought, ""Psh! That'll never happen!"". Boy, was I wrong!

I have been a HUGE Spider-Man fan for at least 21 years. I fell in love with the character at the age of 4 because of the 90s cartoon. Found out that he was comic book character, I ended up going to the library almost every Saturday to go to the comic book section and read Spider-Man, which causes me to find other comics like Batman, Iron Man, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc. Because of Spider-Man, I became a comic book fan of DC and Marvel.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Fan ratings biases the final score here.,"The story was just ok. The acting and some scenes where we can see some guys from the older movies were very nice, but come on, it's not a 9/10 movie.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,no way it should be this high on 250 list,"Its a fine movie, but is not in the top 20 of the greatest movies of all time. Better than leon the professional, come on. My rating of 1 is to hopefully knock it down a few pegs.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Oh delicious,"Okay, we might have a couple of easy ways to go with the script, so that the trama could move along, but it delivers what we wanted as fans, it does not desapoint, and allow us to expect a good newcoming side of Tom Holland's spider-man. And the nostalgia is just beautiful. Easily the best marvel film since Infinity War.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be!","The movie is simply phenomenal. From the acting to the CGI, the score and the cinematic feeling, No Way Home delivers on all fronts. Going from a more goofy teen-action film like ""Far From Home"" into a more serious Spiderman film like ""No Way Home"", brought me exactly what I needed from the Tom Holland movies.

The stakes feel higher than ever before and the nostalgia of the old iconic characters made this movie entertaining the whole way through!

If you want to get the most out of this movie, make sure to watch the old Spiderman movies so you understand the personalities and motives of the villains. If you don't do this, you will not get the full understanding, experience and satisfaction.

Where I live, I have NEVER experienced people clapping mid way through a movie and yelling of excitement. People are good at respecting each other's needs to have a calm and good cinema-experience, but the hype, anticipation and delivery of this film was SO GOOD, that the whole atmosphere of the cinema was filled with energy and love for this movie. Everyone clapped, cheered, cried and laughed. It was truly an experience.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Holy Crap dude,"So this is a super Biased review so take that into effect. This movie is amazing the pacing flows so well 2 hours past in an instant. I grew up in the Fox Kids era, and if you know what that is or you were one too gonna love No Way Home. After the boring ass Eternals and lack luster Black widow Marvel is finally doing what fans wanted letting Spiderman do Spiderman stuff.

10.0,The Best Spider-Man Yet,"Absolutley loved this spiderman its the best of tom hollands spidey movies yet, fast paced with the right amount of humour & action

also great to see the villains from the tobey maguire spiderman trilogy along with andrew garfields 2 spidey movies and not to mention seeing tobey maguire back as an older spiderman along with andrew garfields scene stealing funny & bonkers spiderman

the tag team-team up between the spider-men & the villains battling it out on & around the statue of liberty was truly fun

last time we seen the statue of liberty used in a marvel finale was back in 2000 with x-men

willem dafoes green goblin is truly scary and jamie foxx is alot different this time around & alfred molinas dock ock still has that menacing charm and as for thomas haden church as sandman he kinda got cheated with re-used spiderman 3 footage and the same goes for rhys ifans lizard but other than that its brilliant from start to finish.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

9.0,The Spider-Man movie we've been waiting for,"I'm so happy right now. They really outdid themselves with this one.

Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, ambitious and emotional movie that perfects the art of fanservice even better than Endgame, delivering easily one of the MCU's best movies.

It manages to balance an insane amount of villains like it's easy. They all get a moment to shine, even the ones that inevitably get pushed aside.

Some aspects of the multiverse logic won't make sense if you think about them too much, but other than that, this is the film you've been waiting for.

10.0,The last time I enjoyed these so much was when I saw DarkKnight,"I was engrossed right from the start, and I was engaged every second. It's filled with adventure, friendship, teamwork, love, empathy, and brotherhood.

People in the cinema cheered multiple times when key characters appeared and when a hint of what Spiderman's future holds emerged. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Peter Parker (Holland, owning the role) is revealed to the world as Spider-Man, destroying his life and those of those in close proximity. He implores Dr. Strange (Cumberbatch, compelling) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. I think this is better than the end game.

10.0,"The Amazing, Spectacular, Ultimate Spider-Man Film!","With 'Spider-Man: No Way Home', Marvel Studios delivers an impeccable film on par with 'Avengers: Endgame'. Doing the impossible, it manages to surpass the masterpiece that was 'Spider-Man 2' as the greatest Spider-Man film ever, while effortlessly making it seem like this was nearly 20 years in the making. With flawless performances from its cast, nostalgic references galore, and deep emotional resonance, never before has a piece of superhero cinema so perfectly and lovingly portrayed the essence of its titular hero, or captured the hearts of the web-slinger's adoring fanbase.

I am a maniac whenit comes to watching movies, and i mostly watch slow movies (drams etc.), but growing up as a spiderman-fan myself I had to watch this movie. And all i have to say is, the HYPE IS TOTALY WORTH IT!

Go watch it! Now!!

10.0,BREATHTAKING,"I grew up with spider-man, he was one of my first known superheroes, I watched the first movies, the second series and finally I saw Tom Holland as spider-man and he was amazing, I loved his portret of spidey from the first scene and all the marvel movies with him where great and I had an amazing time. But never have I ever thought about something what I saw here. I was speechless. I saw just one trailer with Dr Octopus with the original actor from the first series with Toby Maguire. *SPOILERS AHEAD* I was glued to the film all the way but my mind was literally blown to pieces when multiverses colided and all the previous villans came WITH ORIGINAL CAST and then finally we saw what made me shiver with excitement and never stopped. Not only villans came to this part of multiverse but also other spideys. Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire together with Tom Holand ladies and gentlemen I was excited like a baby. Three spider-man guys together it reminds me of one meme about it and how I thought it was just a picture which will never come true but oh boy was I wrong. It was marvelous I can't describe it You need to watch this a dream come true and a surprise with little something to those who watched all the movies, the hints where everywhere I..I can't it was magical go watch the movie You will not be dissapointed.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Here's an honest review from a man who loves movies,"Simply put, any kind of movie that gets this sort of hype almost never delivers for my liking.

And here it is, it's the same old. There's a lot of action, there's a plot, and there's a lot of talking. You have script A, which is the important stuff - the meat and potatoes of the experience - the point gets across. Script B is the filler, the time in between to fill out the runtime, but in this case it's mostly comedic relief and pointless conversations, and I didn't find any of it funny and frankly it was mostly boring. The comedic relief writing in any movie ever is mostly ineffective, and this poison always finds its way into most superhero movies. That's an easy thumbs down for me. This formula is like a day in the desert that desperately needs water.

The acting: good. The familiar faces of Marissa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Fox, and Alfred Molina is what made me want to see this movie, albeit they weren't handed with an award winning script but they're old kids on a new block and they haven't lost their touch. Special props to Thomas Hayden Church, watch the movie Sideways to become familiar with how talented he is.

The Spider Mans: not good. What on earth kind of entrance were they thinking for the Spider-Man reveals? Some kids apartment? Really? I loved how nonchalant Tobey McGuire comes in with that weak grin on his face. He knew he was just collecting a pay check and getting the heck out of there to disappear for another 20 years. Andrew Garfield, now I don't know if he was playing Peter Parker or Ashton Kutcher, and I don't think he knows either. I don't think he's a good actor and if this movie wasn't made then he would be putting his acting resume to good use and probably land him a job as a commercial salesman. Tom Holland isn't bad. I want to see him thrive in more serious roles and expand his career away from the Marvel Universe. His blend of Peter and Spidey is pulled off neatly.

Zendaya and Holland's friends are there, they are there to remind you that you are watching a kids movie. I can't take them seriously. This is where Emma Stone and Kirsten Dunst came in handy to add some maturity to these films. They should've left the teenager stuff for Miles Morales and the animated series. I don't mean this as a diss but it doesn't help that MJ and Peters buddy look way too young for their age.

When the hype gets this big, it's not in my deck of cards. You'll either love or hate my review. Now go watch Sideways.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,One of the craziest movies ever,"Somehow they pulled this off. Spiderman No Way Home is an avengers level movie with a giant cast and big things going on.

10.0,Beautifully done,"I started getting tired of all the hype and theories but was still looking forward to the movie. Let me just tell you, I actually APPLAUDED at one point in the movie, and just bruised my friend's arm for all the other incredibly exciting elements.

Not only were they able to introduce Matt Murdock, but they actually DECEIVED US on what the plot elements were in the trailer, and I am incredibly happy they did. At a certain point Jamie electrocuted Molina after he got a new chip, I was worried they were going to revert him back to villainy only for him to pull in at the end. Man, I loved the plot.

Special effects were incredible as always. The introduction of Andrew and Tobey were so intelligently done. I loved everything about it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
2.0,Generic MCU product but this time they ruined characters from past films as well.,"Well... at least it made me appreciate the Sam Raimi movies a bit more.

Every character from past movies is done badly (in the case of the Raimi characters) or even worse (since The Amazing Spider-Man was terrible to begin with). They try to give Hollands Spider-Man a bit more development and growth but too little, too late.

I particularly loved how they subtly introduced Daredevil in it as well, hinting to a marvel's defenders inclusion in the near future.

2.0,Tedious Deux Ex Machina,"Breaking the multiverse.

Yes. Well, if you can do that, then why are you having problems?

As always, these latest Marvel movies go way too far in the powers they give their heroes, to the point it's impossible to believe they could have problems. This makes me unable to get sucked into the movie on-a ""how would you solve this"" hook so I'm just sitting there waiting for the inevitable end of the movie where I know the girl and the guy both survive.

If you like watching explosions, buildings getting smashed, people ping-ponging around at the speed of sound then by all means, enjoy yourself.

Me? I already left the theater to play the pinball machines in the lobby.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Very clever and enjoyable.,"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)-

As long as you've seen the trailer for this film, there are no spoilers in this review.

It's a multiverse film, so it's fairly obvious that they will utilise elements from other Spider-Man incarnations (You must have seen Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018))? It's got a lot of similarities to that.

By doing that, Disney were able to do here what J. J. Abrams was very clever in doing with his reboot of 'Star Trek' (2009). This will now give them a free reign to continue with any ideas that they might have for any of the Spider-Man's or with the ""Spider-Verse"", which is great for the fans.

How they do it is brilliant, if a tiny bit slow to start with. I would have liked them to have brought in the other universe characters a bit sooner, especially the allies and I think that they should have brought back the second ally first, but I suppose that's what we were expecting.

Once all of the characters are in play though it is a high octane film full of the usual wit and joy that only Spidey can bring.

Moving the pace forward could have given them a bit more time at the end of the film to really drive the action and allow more coverage of the people that turned up late, but regardless of that, it's definitely my favourite of Tom's three films so far.

It's not a stand alone film as it literally follows on from 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' (2019) and obviously has references to 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/19) too.

I would suggest that you re-watch the other five (Tobey and Andrew) films or at least refresh your memory on them before viewing this one as I don't actually remember enough of 'The Amazing Spider-Man/2' (2012/14), because I thought that they were terrible and so was Andrew Garfield. He was not what I would call my version of the famous spider guy, so I've only seen them once. Give me Tom or Tobey any time (I've recently watched them again and feel that Andrew was given bad scripts, but actually delivered the character quite appropriately, I think that I was just bitter because I loved Tobey so much and didn't think that he needed replacing).

As a result a lot of the references to Andrew's films were lost on me and any characters that might have been in those films were not easy to recall. I actually questioned if they had been added just to fill out this films cast, they were so forgettable.

They do perhaps bring back too many bad guys too?

What I really do love though is the fact that J. Jonah Jamieson has been the same in every universe. J. K. Simmons really seems to fit the character perfectly for me and it's good to see him used in a way that shows that some things are a constant and can't be changed. (He probably is Spidey in one of the original comic book ""Verses"", just to prove my theory wrong, but I haven't read enough of them to know.) I'm not sure Ned's wig was the right shade or style though.

On another note, Mr Holland is simply a superb actor. Just when I feel like I'm going off of him, I see him on screen and think ""Wow, what a great performance!"" He turns anything he touches to gold. Even in his first film, 'The Impossible' (2012) as a very young lad, he gives his best, as a wonderfully emotive character, which he still brings here. I see a bright future for him.

I am glad that Doctor Strange wasn't used too much in this story, as I was worried that he might have easily taken over, but this film is definitely all about Spider-Man.

I also loved the fact that they brought back such memorable characters from the ""Tobey Universe"" - Doc Ock and The Green Goblin. I've always loved Mr Maguire and his Spider-Man incarnation. For me, the original three films, well let's say two actually, were more recognisable as what I personally understand of Spidey, but the current form with Tom is just very clever in moving it forward and bringing it up to date. His physical form is nice too (What? He's like 25 or something? That's legal!).

The end credits scene is just a trailer full of spoilers for the next Dr Strange, so don't waste your time after the mid credits scene.

I can't wait to see how they move it on now, with so much potential and this wonderful actor.

8.0,Love Willem Dafoe!,"This was an enjoyable addition to the marvel series and a far better formula than the usual, mad villain rises to power, steals the girl, superhero has a down point then bucks up and rescue's girl.

I loved the first 3 spider man films with Tobey Maguire and the amazing Spider-Man films were not great but I like Andrew Garfield, making it brilliant to seem them all in this film.

Green goblin and doctor Octavius were amazing as well. I'm so glad they were in this film.

Zendaya (stupid name) was very average and hardly there in this film, as usual. Tom Holland while nice to look at was also, very average. I feel this was only made worse when compared to Dafoe who was doing some excellent 'insane' acting and breathing life back into this role.

Graphics were poor for a 2022 marvel film. That cost 200 million.... Although I imagine most of that went on the cast.

Well written, decent script, excitable and enjoyable. Which is all you can hope for really with these films.

6.0,"Expecting more, got less","I don't know what to think...

slow start, it's a very slow start and fairly slow middle, a bit over emotional, I was expecting more action, more superhero stuff, but I felt a bit let down and wasn't too impressed, interesting twist of events though... which made up the last third of the film.

The story starts exactly from the end of Far From Home where Peter Parker is revealed as Spider-Man. Public reaction appeared to be subdued apart from the moaning, bickering J. Jonah Jameson.

We have confused bad guys and a superhero who wants to baby sit them. We have Peter's two close friends trying to help ""fight"" the bad guys, where ""fight"" is the least operative word.

Peter's decisions were the cause of lots of damage, destruction and death.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Entertaininment in the Spiderman style,"An entertaining movie for superhero fans, so take your popcorn and settle down. This movie is tailor made for the fans of the Spiderman franchise though it is a bit different in some aspects. Firstly, just like the Avengers series two other actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are roped in make appearances along with Tom Holland. (This is not a spoiler since their names and characters are mentioned in cast in Google). An interesting scene has all 3 having a chat about their experiences in their respective universes. Sample this "" Did you ever get caught with no more web in your hands ?"" and "" Who was the deadliest enemy you fought ?"". Secondly , how would you feel if your superhero is battered, injured, dejected and down in the dumps ? Or better still can you imagine that Spiderman (or Peter Parker if you like) and his two friends want to join MIT ? The usual set of villains are there and Dr Strange ( Cumberbatch) has his magic powers to help out Spiderman. Also their adventures enhanced with mind blowing special effects are there in plenty. A few one liners placed intermittently do amuse. Spiderman's romantic interest MJ (Zendaya) is around though she is now Michelle Jones not Mary Jane. An evil one liner to remember is "" No good deed goes unpunished"". When all 3 form a team to kick evil ass, one Spiderman complains that he is not used to fight in a team! Fair enough.

So the movie is great for fans of every spiderman but its just takes it that one step further by bringing back Andrew and Toby theres no more arguments over who's the best because when you see them together you realise you love each and every one for the own personalisation of spiderman.

8.0,"Great, but a tad overrated","It certainly gave the fans what they wanted, but I found some of the plot elements a bit contrived. Conveniently bringing other spidermen from other universes to fight their villains was certainly fun, but it threw away a lot of my suspension of disbelief in the realism, even moreso than Infinity War and Endgame. This made it harder to consider the stakes as serious.

I suppose that is forgivable for the amount of fanservice and ties back to the roots that added in an original twist, however. I still feel that an 8/10 fits this best and the 9/10 most seem to prefer is slightly above where it should be.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

This movie had some AMAZING parallels.

One of them being the scene where mj falls from the statue of liberty and is caught by andrew garfield. Clearly referencing to gwen stacy's death.

Yes, it is true, this movie not only contained almost every spiderman villain you can think of, but also contained all of the spider-man's.

I loved the scene when tom holland's spiderman finally released all that anger or green goblin and proper beat him up. Punching, kicking and everything.

Sad death scenes. Not gonna spoil it for u tho.

U have to watch and find out.

10.0,10 spiders of 10,"How to describe in words a film that caused you just a storm of real, genuine emotions? How to describe the wildest feeling of nostalgia, butterflies in your stomach that begin to tickle you from the inside, when another familiar cult character appears on the screen, to the enthusiastic sighs of the audience, when he utters another phrase that has already become legendary, in response to which the entire audience explodes in applause? How to describe all this? 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is an absolutely unique film event that probably won't happen again in our lifetime. It was clear even before its release, and many were waiting impatiently, with excitement, what this movie was preparing for us. People have called it the most ambitious comic book movie (at least from Marvel), and I'm ready to raise both hands in agreement!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Nostalgic and Masterpiece!!,"A true rollercoaster of 90's kid! This movie brought back memories of my childhood! Finally, I see Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina in theatre screen (My dream has come true)

2.0,Overrated,"Created my first IMDb account just to add some sanity here.

This movie was simply not good. It was very illogical how Dr Strange agreed to on a whim erase everyone's memories, and when Peter wanted to start ""helping"" the bad guys I wanted to walk out of the cinema because I could figure out the rest of the movie right there, so predictable. And the conversations later on between the spidermans was just cringe.

6.0,Great idea but....,"This movie had a fun and exciting idea bringing the 3 Spider-Man's and all the villains we loved watching spider man fight together with their own stories and backgrounds. My problem with this movie lies within Peter Parkers (Tom Holland's) decision making. I do not blame Tom Holland and would go as far to say he did a good job in this movie.

However the plot seemed ridiculous to me and here is why!

Spider-Man's identity is known by everyone and it's thought by everyone that he is a villain other than by his friends and family. Yes this may be a problem for Spider-Man but what's a bigger problem for spider man? Him and his friends aren't accepted into college. Instead of ringing the college up and trying to convince the college otherwise, as made a joke by the film, what is the logical thing to do? Ask dr strange to cast a spell which can mess with universes and could potentially destroy your whole world.

What makes it even more ridiculous (I know it's a movie) is that dr strange and Spider-Man didn't even talk about and plan exactly what they want the spell to do before casting this potentially world destroying spell letting in villains from other universes and who knows what else could have been let in. Instead during the spell Peter Parker adds tweaks to the unpredictable spell whilst dr strange is casting it causing all of this and dr strange accepts these tweaks. I do not fully blame Spider-Man for this because he is a young 17 year old kid and therefore will make stupid decisions. However a wise wizard excepting to chop and change his spell whilst casting it potentially putting the world at risk, may I remind you so that Peter Parker can give his friends a second chance at getting into college seems utterly ridiculous.

With all this being said these two heroes, dr strange and Spider-Man have recently gone through saving half the population from thanos but now want to risk tampering with time and the whole world because of a college application decline. Particularly nearing the end of the movie I couldn't help but to laugh to think the whole world is collapsing and going to be destroyed because of this silly reason.

Whilst this does seem like an overall negative review I did love all the actors coming into one film even though at times it did feel a bit cramped. Particularly the green goblin portrayed a creepy and evil character you look for in a villain. He is character who is unpredictable and gives off a truly dangerous vibe.

I would have accepted and enjoyed the movie to have much better and logical reasoning behind the need to cast the spell in the first place.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Spider-man: Endgame,"In the film, whole lot of human emotions are shown in an beautiful way. Emotions like love, sadness, pain, brutal rage from betrayal are exceptionally outstanding. While watching the last scene(I shall not reveal the scene, of course, no spoilers :) ), I must confess I felt my heart ripped away. Personally, I think it is the best spiderman film hitherto.

I, being a doctor strange fan, felt a little disappointed. Because, It was shown like he was being a little impatient through out the film rather than being a mentor to a person who is in a lot of emotional trouble.

Nevertheless, the second half of the film is outstanding. I felt hair standing on my hands in every action scene.

Mid credit scene leaves a very fine plot for the next spiderman films and post credit scenes is more than masterpiece. You'll love it!!

On a final note, the film was amazing!! Watch the film in 3d...u will enjoy it definitely.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,The most emotional and satisfying cinematic experience of my entire life,"Walking out of the cinema after watching Spider-man: No Way Home, I was absolutely shocked and amazed to the point where I was shaking and struggling to not cry. As an avid Marvel and Spider-man fan, this movie was extremely satisfying to watch. I absolutely adored the new dimensions given to Tom Holland's Spider-man and how the original story of Spider-man was integrated into this franchise. Also loved the Andrew Garfield Spider-man reveal (almost everyone in the cinema audibly gasped) and how we got to check in on Tobey and Andrew's spidey-selves (Andrew cracking Tobey's back for him? Absolute gold). The character deaths were heart-wrenching and beautifully executed, and the teasers we got for the next spider-man trilogy and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness in the post-credit scenes made me very excited for the next phase of Marvel (and especially how this movie may interact with the Disney Plus shows). Overall, this film is by far one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched, period. I would recommend this to anyone who has watched the previous Spider-man series' and/or has watched any of the recent Marvel productions.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,The best Spider-Man film ever made!,"And I do not say that lightly. This is by far the best Spider-Man film ever made (yes, even better than spiderverse) just go and watch it if you haven't already.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,A lot of fun,"I thought this was probably the most entertaining Spider-Man live action movie that has been made. Even at 2 1/2 hours, it left me wanting more. The characters were way more likable here than their other appearances, and I was way more invested in this story. One thing that bothered me was how the plot depended on an incredibly goofy character decision. I didn't think there was any way a person would ever choose that route--even a fictional superhero. Also, I wasn't as enamored with the villains as most people seem to be. But the high points more than made up for that. Definitely worth watching back.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
2.0,Overrated at best,After hearing about this film I had moderate expectations but the film didn't come close. Sure Tom Holland can act and it was nice to see some familiar faces but after watching it I was left wondering if it was worth my while. I think that the praise that the film received took away from the hype that Dune deserved which was a film that was well above my high expectations of it.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,.,"So many expectations, so many hopes and merged photos. For any fan, the new part of ""Spider-Man"" is always the main release of the year. So far, films with Holland's participation have not disappointed, but they have not jumped to the bar set by Sam Raimi. Did Watts manage to create something more, or is there really nothing except references in the film?

The continuation of the Spider-Man saga captures us at the moment when ""Far from Home"" ends, at the moment of the opening of Spider-Man's identity. A friendly neighbor is caught up in a storm from all sides: the authorities accuse Mysterio of murder, and society turns into a crowd of paparazzi and does not let Peter breathe even at school. In an attempt to stop this madness, the spider turns to Doctor Strange, but the oblivion spell does not work correctly and instead of everyone forgetting about Parker's duality, portals to the multiverse open from where our old acquaintances come.

The main thing you need to know about the end of the new trilogy is a movie made by fans for fans. The creators even make up memes that they came up with based on old paintings about a spider. Such a balanced balance of humor and drama, as in this part, it is difficult to remember anywhere else.

A huge number of characters in this part works both in plus and minus. On the one hand, it gives the viewer a lot of emotions from meeting old acquaintances (in some cases, the hall turned into a mini stadium meeting a favorite performer) and an excellent opportunity for a metashoot, on the other hand, it decently overloads the plot. John Watts tried to balance the film by introducing the characters gradually, thereby increasing the timing of the picture, and in fact he managed not to slide into mincemeat of constantly changing faces and jokes. The middle of the film, however, slightly loses momentum. There are a lot of climactic moments in the film when you have already cried all your rivers, and you need to cry another scene again.

Do not think that the film is bad, this is fundamentally wrong. The middle, which has sunk in dynamics, is the only negative that can be detected at a glance. ""Spider-Man: There is no Way Home"" reveals all the signs of a great blockbuster, which has cool music (even classic themes from old parts), and great action scenes, and most importantly, it has a soul. A film in which the world can collapse at any second, and Peter goes crazy before our eyes, brings kindness and human relations to the fore. So, a little schizophrenic episodes with doppelgangers give Holland's character a development that he seemed to have missed being in the Avengers. He became a hero, but he didn't learn how to be Spider-Man. Now Watts has corrected this misunderstanding and has done it in a truly brilliant style.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A Spiderman movie as good as the Original Trilogy,"Wow, What can I say about this movie?, For one thing it's so much better than ""Far From home"" (2019), It's so good in fact, That it even rivals the first two Spider-Man/Tobey Maguire movies as far as story and acting goes and quality as well, Which is really good, And the special effects are top notch!, So down to the story, Following the ending of ""Far from home"" where Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) reveals Peter Parker is Spider-Man!, So everyone now knows Peter Parker's secret Identity, The media follows him relentlessly, The police and other authority figures want to question Peter Parker/Spiderman, His friends and families lives are affected negatively as well, So what must Spider-Man do?, Ask for Doctor Strange's help of course and make everyone forget he is Spider-Man with a Spell, And of course the spell goes horribly wrong and that's when the movie gets really interesting, Such a good movie, I really enjoyed it, Great job Marvel Studios!, You have really out done yourselves!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

7.0,"so close, yet so far..","This movie has many elements that beg to be change/tweaked. It really keeps the movie from perfection and being the best of the MCU. Pacing is the smallest issue with this movie, the first act being the slowest, and the second dragging, making the movie seem longer than it is. Next problem I have is the way that Tobey and Andrew were introduced. Ugh! Why just why?! This could had been soooo spectacular and no it just wasn't it simple relied on your love of the characters to carry the scene and while it worked it wasn't impactful. Lastly is this director and his horribly bland shots, while there are some great shots in the movie, the dialogue scenes suffer the most from this boring style. What worked, worked. The acting was all there, especially from William Defoe as green goblin, and Andrew Garfields Spider-Man.

But you would still feel the excitement and emotion of watching this, with only a little bit of confusion.

At the end of the day this is an extremely exciting, funny, emotional, and fast-paced movie, with only a few minor problems, that is only a bit better if you've watched the other Spider-Man's. With all this in mind I hope this encourages you to watch Spider-Man: No Way Home along with the rest of the Spider-Man's!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,A nostalgia trip for the ages,"The movie is an enjoyable, Marvel/Disney formula, spectacle that delves deeply into the nostalgia train through the use of the Multiverse. While the movie is enjoyable, it lacks the punch that FFH offered instead relying solely on the return of previous cast members Maguire, Garfield, Dafoe, Molina and Foxx to pull the film through. Defoe put on an absolute masterclass and it was a welcome sight to see both Maguire and Garfield don the suits again but it leaves one thinking that would the film have been as good if these were replaced by different actors? It remains to be seen, however NWH provides another exciting entry into the Marvel universe and gives me high hopes for the multiverse going forward.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

5.0,"Worst one, sadly.","I thought I'll watch one if not the best Marvel creation, but it turned out to be the opposite.

The amount of sillyness packed in this one.. It's just annoying.

Let me highlight the biggest one.

Each of the previous Spider-Man movies had atleast 1 antagonist that they had hard times with through a whole movie. And their goal was to stop them, not to ""cure"" them. They didn't had a clue of how or why they turned evil. Now suddenly, they all know these answers, they also know the exact solution of how to turn them back to be normal/good. And it doesn't even take a whole movie to not just to stop all of the former antagonists, but to cure them.

The characters were shallow, the actors made me think I was watching actors and not characters.

It was just all wrong. All the interesting parts were missing from the movie. Why he has to hide who he is? Why is it not clear for everyone that Spider-Man is the good guy? The conversation about the web and other differences? (Let me explain, in order to partially know these answers you must watch the previous movies, but the characters do not know anything about each other, many people doesn't know neither or they just don't remember and this is why they should have added these parts. To give the characters more character.)

This is easily one of the worst Marvel movies. And I have no idea why would anyone think it was good.

And there are more plotholes and problems than these. It was just the biggest of all.

Lastly, I'd like to thank you all who paid to watch this movie, you're helping killing movies. In the very near future movies like The Godfather will not be made because it's not about sillyness and colorfull dresses. (Just see how much money a bad movie like this makes and how much money a good one makes.. Barely covers the costs. You're all Marvel's herd.)",Spider-Man: No Way Home

9.0,This is a Absolute... WOW (Spider-Man: No Way Home Review),"Spider-Man: No Way Home is the best Spider-Man Movie ever! I mean, everything is done right, and it boosted Tom Holland's Spider-Man to the top, as he is the Spider-Man the fans have been waiting for. This is a emotional movie, a suspenseful movie, and overall, an amazing comic book movie! Seeing the villains all come back was absolutely incredible, and oh my god, Willem Dafoe's acting is literally phenomenal! He can change between Norman Osborn and Green Goblin like day and night! Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus is awesome, and by the end of this movie, you love him! And the new design they gave Jaimie Foxx's Electro looks great, but I felt like Sandman and The Lizard were sort of sidelined, but they were still fun to watch their interactions with the others. But now, let's just cut to the chase, seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back in the Spider-Man Roles was emotional and awesome to see on screen, and the applause and cheering that followed was just a dream come true! The Three Spideys Banter together is so fun and enjoyable to see on screen. And even seeing Ned and MJ talk to them was fun! May's Death was really sad, and it really tugged your heartstrings, and Doctor Strange's addition in the movie was fun! And when we get to that ending, where Tom's Peter makes the sacrifice to save the Multiverse, it gets really emotional!

The movie's special effects are fine, so are Tom Holland and Dr Strange. Nothing fancy, but fine. The storyline is okay, but the acting is just so bad by literally every other character. The worst has to be the other two Spidermen, and the scenes with all three of them are just a torture to watch. I would've guessed a 3rd grader wrote the screenplay. I felt like my IQ just dropped 50 points listening to it.

In comparison, the previous worst-rated Ragnorak was so much more enjoyable. It was ACTUALLY funny, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Chris Hemsworth makes a good comedian, but Tom Holland doesn't.

Even the inside joke as him being as the worst one among them the apiderman trio that made me sad. His performance was great but the script and movie overall didn't do his performance justice. I Hope we can see him as spiderman in future too. I don't think tobey will reprise his role as our beloved web swinger but i can understand that. The villains were good but Jamie Fox and William Defoe's performance were absolutely amazing. Other villains were just there didn't had that much impact on the movie in my opinion.

10.0,Truly amazing,"No spoilers, but this movie had me crying happy and sad tears and has to be one of the most original superhero stories ever told. At any point in your life, if you EVER loved Spider-Man, you will love this movie. Perfection.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Absolutely Phenomenal.,"Can't believe they somehow delivered on the amazing amount of hype this had! It has the heart, the ambition, and the fan service we so desperately needed and wanted. SPOILER!: I absolutely love how they made the MCU Spider-Man be independent from the Stark Industries and have a place of his own, make his own costume out of cloth, and have his iconic fresh look with the classic spider! Also SPOILER: Me and the rest of my theatre was just amazed and out of words for the inevitible return of Andrew Garfield AND Tobey Maguire! And Somehow this wasn't the only thing that carried the movie. They redeemed Tom Holland's Spider-Man with the amazing cherography and story-dialouges. Loved the villian's chemistry with each other and Peter. And I was worried that they coudn't make Willem DaFoe's Green Goblin (who was drop-dead AMAZING) the classic arch-nemesis of Tom Holland's Spider-Man due to the fact that GG is from another universe. I am thrilled to announce that I have been wrong! Everyone did an amazing job in this amazing piece of a movie. I guess if I wanted to have a nitpick it would be that we didn't get to see Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Mans throw that many punches with the baddies but regardless of that it was still phenomenal. This movie and everyone involved in it knocked it straight out of the park. Subdued my doubts for the cliched MCU formula for now. LET'S GO SPIDEY!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,10 star it is not,"The opening is cringe worthy. Wet sad eyes dominate. What is it with all the crying in movies lately? The main actress can do so much better, but I'm sure it was the director. I guess its geared more to the 20 and younger audience. It was wayyyyy too long. Not worth the money or time.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,I'm trying really hard to like it as much as I want to,"Was it good? Yes. Was it great? No. I read so many people talk about the villains having so much depth in this film but honestly I disagree, that depth was already handed to us in previous films. Do I like the villains? Sure I did but it wasn't anything new nor cutting edge. The big moment we all expected to happen was laid on in the most odd and cheeses fashion that it was almost the nail in the coffin saying that this movie was dreadful. It's saving grace was the dialog between them when they finally meet even if parts were thick! All in all it was great popcorn fun and I'm sure many will enjoy this, yo mich rehashing foe me to call it great bit as far as cash grabs go this was one of the better ones.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,You're losing your touch Marvel,"I was sceptical about going to watch this film, because after all the spoilers that came out on social media (courtesy of Tom Holland) I thought that there would be no surprises in the movie. However, being a dedicated Marvel fan I believed they will surpass whatever they have shown in the trailers. I was so wrong.

Let's begin with the appearances of the other 2 Spidermen, Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire. All of us knew they are in the movie, courtesy of spoilers, but could their appearances not have been atleast at different points in the movie? Instead they appear one after the other, like some TV show hosts. As soon as you see the second gateway being opened by Ned, you know it's gonna be Toby. Since when did Marvel movies become so predictable? Also, they showed all the villains from multiverses in the trailers. ALL OF THEM! Why couldn't you keep atleast one hidden for the movie? A little bit of suspense maybe?

Then comes the fight/action sequences. I daresay that this movie has the worst/least exciting fight sequences in all the 8 Spiderman live action movies ever made. Don't agree with me? Remember the last fight sequence from 'Far From Home', and how Spidey just ravages through Mysterio's drones, or the Electro vs. Spidey in The Amazing spiderman 2 with Garfield. The sequences in this movie are way too weak, when you take into consideration that it has triple the strength.

Some good bits though, like how the have portrayed Aunt May, and her importance in Peter's life. Really loved it. Also, Daredevil's appearance was a shocker, although nothing much came out of it. And I have always loved Benedict Cumberbatch's comic timing as Dr. Strange, or Stephen. But all in all, this was a just a dent in a legacy overhyped by overpaid teenagers on social media, and people going gaga over it without even setting real expectations. Very disappointed!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Why Spider-Man is the Greatest Superhero! Fan Service at it's best!,"**MAJOR SPOILERS** The movie was phenomenal with so many call backs to past films and it was the perfect fan service film! I truly wish it was longer because it is sheer gold. I hope we get to see Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man again somewhere down the line. For all those people complaining about Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man, this movie quells all those complaints. This is a high stakes high octane adrenaline rush of a roller coaster with so many ups and downs! Spidey goes through the absolute most in this! We get shades of the Sinister Six in this film without the film feeling bogged down by the sheer number of characters. I wish that Mysterio had shown up again as a villain to take his rightful place in the six, but hey, maybe in the future!. I love how each character got to say lines from the past and the movie was over all very funny and entertaining. Some of my favorite quips were Doctor Octopus saying ""the power of the Sun in the palm of my hands"", the Green Goblin saying ""I'm something of a scientist myself"", and Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker complaining about his back problems. I also love how Andrew Garfield Spider-Man got a second chance to save a Spider-Man love interest from falling to her death. This was such a beautiful movie and I can't believe they actually showed the spider sense like how it is depicted in the comics in a live-action film. I marked out so many times and I was paying attention to everything. I even noticed that on that van they had a tribute to Steve Ditko as they graffiti his name on the side of it. The fact that they had Aunt May say the ""with great power, there also must come great responsibility"" line straight out of the comics gave me chills! And the fact that they had the Classic Spiderman costume color scheme at the end! This movie was totally awesome and I can't wait to watch it 100 more times! When the three Spider-Men share the screen, it is every bit as iconic as we all imagined it would be! Such chemistry, and such an amazing, spectacular and ultimate superhero movie! Only Spider-Man 2 can boast about being so good of a Spider-Man movie. This movie, in my opinion, is right next to Infinity War and Endgame in scale and execution. Don't miss out on the event of a lifetime!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

7.0,"Hmmm...not as good as expected, just not bad","Storyline is literally fine, I won't talk much on it, I will just focus on some setting and logic issue.

1. Whoever teleported to MCU must be someone who knows Peter Parker is Spiderman? Electro? Venom? You can even see Rhino in the crack of Multi-universe...

2. The purpose of Sandman is to go back to his own universe and stay with his daughter, then why does he help ""villains"" to fight?

3. Dr. Strange is so steady to cast the ""forgetting"" spell (I don't remember the name) at the beginning, but so dull and hesitated at last, I know he saw Peter's plan worked (but only in term of Science), but shouldn't he be the one propose to cast the spell initiatively instead of Peter? It's more like the movie wants us to see Peter's growth, but in a deliberate way.

Anyhow, I still have fun watching it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,Meh,"I have not enjoyed the movie at all, in honesty I watched it in two parts because it didn't make sense.

Q2 - if Dr Strange is in control of the Mirror World why did it take him a lot of time to go out of it?

Q3 - if something is happening to the universe why is noone trying to help Q4 - do you find it believable that all anyone needs to transform a reptile or a sandman back to a man can be found in a school lab?

Q5 - why were the other two Spidermen added, Dr Strange said that the spell pulled people desiring Spiderman, so why would any Spiredman desire himself?

Q6 - Mysterio said who is Spiderman, not where he lives, how did the tv found out so fast?

Q7 - why are there so many positive reviews, the movie was drenched in CGI, the sequences with no CGI were not believable to be real and all looked like a set!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,No Way Home,"No way home is an example of how a fan service for fans should be designed. All the villains are perfectly matched, the stupid Goblin mask is removed and he has acquired a more spectacular look. The story of Aunt May and Uncle Ben is done wisely, and here you really get into death. Does the doctor spoil all the raspberries with his superpowers? No, because we don't know their limits, and we have to take his word for it.

The curse of the movie spider was gracefully bypassed when 5 villains were dragged into the film, but in the end the fights came out 1 on 1. How so? Watch the movie.

Even the idea of a multiverse, which usually serves as an excuse for any heresy, is appropriate and very necessary here.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,Better use this time to watch another movie,"From the very beginning the movie was overwhelmed by silly, kinda stupid and not funny at all little jokes that made the idea and the story hard to understand and the movie not catchy at all. Further on, the idea behind this film was nice and innovative but those kids (MJ and Ned), with all the talking and little jokes ruined it all for me. Villains fight was non existing and the main characters are just kids which is not suitable at all, in my opinion and, at some points, made me feel very uncomfortable. For me, it was a big disappointment and I would like to get my time spent to watch it back.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

Me and my friend cried a couple times, we laughed a lot. The amount of references to other movies were amazing. The credits were amazing, they had me in awe the animation was stunning and mesmerizing. The visual effects team was amazing, they made so many amazing and visually pleasing scenes. So over all I would have to say that this movie has now made its place onto my top three marvel movies of all time.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,A little above average,"I don't often watch superhero movies. I hadn't seen a Spider-Man flick since ""Into the Spiderverse"" (the animated one), which was good, and before that I hadn't seen one since ""Spider-Man 3"" with Tobey McGuire. I completely missed Andrew Garfield's turn as the character, and hadn't seen Tom Holland before either.

Some of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" reminded me why I'm not that interested in these types of movies. As always, it's too long, and the special effects don't impress me. When was the last time you were genuinely impressed by special effects in a movie? For me it was some time in the early 2000s. Also, I never find superheroes particularly interesting as characters. Batman is perhaps the most interesting because he's a tormented, almost anti-heroic figure. The X-Men are also among the best because of the whole ""anti-mutant discrimination as a metaphor for racism"" thing. But Peter Parker? His unflappable, wholesome boy-next-door thing keeps threatening to get old.

The other characters unfortunately were no more interesting. Sam Raimi was able to make Peter Parker, Aunt Mae and MJ feel like real people. Here they're really just stand-ins.

There were some things I liked about the movie though. At about the half-way point something I'd never seen in a movie happened: the other actors who played Spider-Man appeared in this one, as did most (all?) of the villains from all the other Spider-Man pics. This finally got me invested: seeing them all interact with each other was interesting. I was going to give it a six-out-of-ten for that, but then the movie ended in a scene that actually felt kind of emotive, and to cap it all off, De La Soul were played over the end credits. So I had to bump it up a point for that.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Surprising,"This movie manages to be exciting and better than the previous two.

The story is convincing and entertaining, the justifications are believable, there are emotional moments, there are many pleasant surprises, and the whole plot is shocking. I think that in the story part there are no negative aspects, but in terms of the visual, it is a setback for the trilogy, since the action scenes are not like to the ones in the previous film, the special effects need to improve, the direction is not very committed since some scenes seem to be done very quickly and without much effort, there is no planning of where each character was going to be in the scenes or where the camera could widely capture what was happening. The ending seems confusing to me, but maybe it will be resolved in some other Marvel movie.

Without a doubt, it is a film full of very effective surprises and that improves in terms of story and script compared to the other two, it is definitely worth it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Somehow better than Endgame Loved every seconds...,"With Peter Parker(Holland, owning the role) revealed to the world as Spider-Man, he and those closest to him have their lives ruined. He implores Dr Strange(Cumberbatch, compelling as always) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. But there are unintended consequences.

If you're not interested in reading an extremely positive review of this, turn back now. I can't believe they actually did it. There's no way(eh?) that this should work. It should end up overstuffed, like Raimi's third entry did. Somehow, the fan service and nostalgia-bait does not overwhelm, and this has a real heart to it. The references are plentiful without ending up obnoxious. They managed to find a way to give the large cast enough character moments and pathos that I wouldn't want a single one of them removed. The balance between drama and comedy is on point. No one just disappears into the background, and this doesn't take away the tragedy of them. The action is big, not excessively so. A few awkward parts barely detract. The long runtime doesn't feel excessive.

This features a little strong and suggestive language. If you care even a tiny bit about any fictional being that appears in this, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it. 6/10.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,ONE OF THE FINEST COMIC BOOK FILMS EVER!,"Jon Watts' dazzling, exciting, funny, big-screen superhero blockbuster that really delivers. It picks up where the previous film ""Far From Home"" left off, Spider-Man's secret identity as Peter Parker, wonderfully played by Tom Holland, has been revealed to the world, which has made his life utterly chaotic so in desperation he turns to Doctor Strange, superbly played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who casts a powerful spell to make everyone forget that he is Spider-Man, but something goes terribly wrong and the multiverse is shattered, which has the effect of bringing back nefarious super villains from the past that threaten the destruction of the entire world. This genre epic is a real game changer with astounding action sequences, eye-popping visual effects, a strong nostalgic feel, and a few big surprises. Solid direction Watts, with impeccable performances by Zendaya, Willem Defoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Fox, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, J. K. Simmons, Tony Revolori, and Benedict Wong. The best and most enjoyable Marvel film ever. Highly recommended.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,I've missed having this much fun with movies...,"71/100

The first half of Spider-Man: No way home seems hopeless, exactly like almost every other marvel movie we've seen: a bad screenplay with painfully unfunny jokes that feel like they only serve the purpose of extending the movie's own runtime to 2 1/2 hours. It almost feels like it relies on the movie's other aspects -the daring cinematography, the innovative editing and directing for marvel's own standards and a surprisingly good score attributed to Giacchino- to reduce the amount of people gazing towards what's lacking. For a hot minute, I thought those were the movie's true colors. That is, of course, until the movie itself marks a half of its second act and plants the foundation for the third one.

The actors, despite a lack of material, deliver surprising and attentive performances which, fortunately enough, help give Holland's character a good-enough arc if we forget the other two movie's existence. However, it is necessary to point allude to the fact that some of the character's motivations may come across as contradictory from what has been seen from them in the past, leaving me with a picture of uncertainty as to what the writers actually had in their hands.

Overall, just like any other Marvel movie, we can attribute Spider-Man: No Way Home a good entertainment value, one of which I, being honest entirely, had missed from movies and only recieved fully until now...",Spider-Man: No Way Home

5.0,Nostalgia doesn't make a good movie,"Spoilers for the whole movie! PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOURE WANTING THE FULL MOVIE EXPERIENCE TO FORM YOURE OWN OPINION:

I left the theatre in tears, but not the happy kind. Understandably seeing the 3 main cinamatic spidermen I've grown up with along side the best bad guys from the many spiderman movies together brought alot of fan service and excitement in the scenes they shared. This excitement turned to anticipation and then quickly terned to disappointment when I realised this was the main pay-off of the movie. I was so sure there would be more but once I got past this i realised the movie was so full of poor pacing an ending that tries to be deep but back tracks on everything else we've seen from the MCU. Understand that the ending doesn't work not because spiderman got a poordeal but because it felt so out of touch with everything I've learnt through watching the MCU.

Firstly I hated the ""just coz"" mentality of the science in this movie. Yes mavel does it all the time but never to this extent. The whooooole movie was ""just coz"" with no attempt at any kind of reasonable explanation to suspend belief. I dont accept that just because spiderman wanted to cure them all that there's some magic cure to a guy litarally made out of sand. I don't except that electro just magically came out looking like Jamie with a new personality and I should just run with it because the characters are also surprised (yes I understand that there was talk about the electricity working different, but come on, realy?). Why did lizard basically do nothing the whole movie? Doc ocs tech was so easily controlled remotely it makes me question why Peter never used this to an advantage outside of his costume, he seamed to know what he was doing straight away once it happened. Sandmans motives where pure garbage. He should know better that spiderman is a better choice to allign with than the others. He litarally had nothing to lose. He ether gets cured and goes back or he just goes back later. The other villains weren't even trying to get the box to go home which is exactly the opposite of what he wanted. Also why cant he look like a normal human like in the original movie. He's stuck looking like a pile of sand the whole movie, contradicting the original which left me confused when he did get cured at the end and he looked normal. Was it to not spoil the original actor comming back? Come on.

I would also like to ask ""why isn't peter allowed a happy ending?"". I get that not every movie has to be happy and spiderman has had alot of sad endings through comic and movie history but it made no sence the way they did it in the context of the MCU. The way I understood it, because it was very much show dont tell (which I actually appreciated) Is because he wants to protect his loved ones he doesn't tell them who he really is. Sorry but Iron man managed just fine. IRON MAN, the guy Peter looked up to more than anyone and still references when he's feeling insecure or unsure of himself. Iron Man had a wife, a child and then chose to make the sacrifice for their and the worlds benefit. Iron man is litarally the poster boy for do what you want. His identity was litarally on public display and aside from the time he provoked a terrorist he lived a relatively normal life with his family, who again understood what it ment to be the family of Iron Man. I get that Peter is ment to be ""better"" than Iron man as quoted in homecoming but you can't show Iron man with his loving family and a daughter who now has a future (its tragic he's dead but his family goes on right?) and expect me not to wonder what made Tony different. It's not like it was pepper and his child that died. As far as I can tell their gonna be apart of the next phase of marvel. So again, why can't Peter be happy? PLENTY of superheroes in the MCU have friends shong chi is litarally bumbing around with his best friend the whole of the 10 rings movie and even brings her with him at the end. Again I've got no issues with the movie ending sad but it just felt un justified.

The absolute biggest disappointment to me though, more than anything the movie did was the handling of the ""spoilers"". Marvel really can't handle that Toby and Andrew got spoiled months before the release of the movie and through interviews and statement it felt like we really hadn't seen everything and we could expect some surprises throughout the movie. Aside from Daredevil who I expected thanks to the Hawkeye show there was nothing that shocked me. I fully went into this movie expecting Toby and Andrew thanks to the trailers and leaks from months ago and in all honestly how could I not expect them when the classic Villains are back and Andrew Garfield couldn't keep a straight face in any interview. They also dangled the expectations of the sinister six in front of everyone. There was not a single person who wasn't excited for this. They showed 5 bad guys in the trailers which is weird if you'd wanna keep something a surprise so it was pretty much expected that the sixth Villains would be kept a secret buuuuuut nope. They dangled it and there were only 5 which they showed in the trailer. I felt like an idiot waiting for this last villain to just show up but it never happened. Marvel tried to subvert expectations but it only really works when what you get is somewhat comparable in the enjoyment of what was expected.

I really expected more from the way this movie was promoted. There is litarally an interview with the three leads where they get asked ""people feel they've seen everything thanks to the trailers, what do you think?"" And they respond as if there's this amazing thing that they've kept secret and no one could possibly picture where they're going with this. But there wasn't. The trailers really did give everything away.

What was up with venom? Was he just there to further fill seats. I remember watching the end credits to the carnage movie and getting so excited just to end up with a second after credit scene that looks like its heading the right direction just to have him go back to his reality and leve behind a bit of venom for someone other than Tom hardy to pick up and use. That just felt like the last slap in the face after just being disappointed. They hinted at alot more than what they deliverd and I think that was one of my biggest issue with this movie. If Andrew and Toby got spoilt just leave it at that and move on but dont start dodging questions and making us think there's more there when there isn't. But even then I cant say the story was anything great. Just characters not acting right and doing things to progress the story. Some strange pacing at times, not alot of witty dialogue from spideman considering that's kinda his main thing while in the suite and thus was made worse considering there was three of them. I can't say much for how doctor strange was acting as I dont know a huge amount about him but for sure that was a completely different character to the strange we've seen in the MCU and he's acting more like his old full of himself doctor Steven strange personality. Just outta nowhere to make the movie work I guess.

Spite all I've said there were aspects of the movie I enjoyed. The interaction with the three spidermen was always gonna make me happy. It was great seeing how they reacted to one another and there dialogue out of costume was pretty good. I also think green goblin was nicely fleshed out with an amazing performance by Willem Dafoe, highlighting the split personality of Norman Osborne.

Ill conclued with with some simple comments in list form: -May dying was a nice change of pace and I think that was a nice character moment which he needed to be able to relate to Andrew and Toby's spidermen.

-Some of the quotes said by the villains to pay omage to their original performances was a nice touch of fan service (maybe overboard sometimes but I thought it was nice).

-I liked that they gave Andrew some redemption

-I really liked that they didn't just say everything that was happening. Like why Andrew was crying when he caught MJ from falling. Doesn't need to be explained, the fans understand.

-The story leaves alot to be desired and the ending just felt like a way to set up for future movies but wasn't justified.

-I felt like Marvel subverted expectations in the wrong way (who wants to see the sinister 5?, defeats the purpose of even having that many villains).

-they gave away everything I the trailers. No surprise villains and even the people bot confirmed might as well have been.

-I understand there are more spiderman movies comming out and most likely spiderman will get his happy ending eventually but after all the teasing, promotion and looking back on it now with hind sight, litarally everything had already been spoiled and Marvel tried to convince everyone there was more to see.

Conclusion: It really did come down to how many people they could get in those seats. They presented a fan service film that deliverd on nostalgia but really not much else. I just cant see this as a good movie purely based on nostalgia. Sorry Marvel.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,"Cashing in on old characters and storylines, nothing new here","The recent Spider-Man films have bought so many new, creative ideas, stories and characters to the table.

Im talking about the first 2 Tom Holland Spidey's and Into the Spiderverse. Tom Holland has great character himself and the supporting cast in Micheal Keaton, Zendaya and Gylenhal were a breath of fresh air - Mysterio's adaption to the big screen was so clever and well executed.

The Into the Spiderverse was stylistically incredible - it has the feels. The look; music, characters and emotion that were completely new to Spider-Man and an excellent tributes to the comics.

No Way Home feels like it's set out to cash in on all of the above and shoehorn the great characters from the Sony Spider-Man's into the MCU without adding anything new. Writing this I'm trying to think of something new from this film and simply cannot.

If you wished and imagined what would happen when these characters collided then you might think this is the film you'd been waiting for. But take a look at DC's Batman Vs Superman...we all know what happened there.

Some things should remain ""what ifs"". If your your favourite past sporting heroes played against today's you'd be disappointed for real and this is a good analogy for this film. It's like Mike Tyson fighting Tyson Fury.

It feels like Sony has had a board meeting and said ""into the Spiderverse did well, what about the multiverse"". It will pay off in the short term, I'm sure with big draw to the film, but people will stop coming back for more if there's no new content.

The action is good and there's nostalgia there but if you were expecting the recent quality of Spiderman films, you'll be disappointed. As well as the lack of new ideas, the dialogue felt so weird and awkward, particularly in the first 2/3's of the film.

This film is a copy/paste of the best lines from old movies - ""Hello Peter"", with no depth or new motives for the characters coming back. If you love nostalgia and those older Spiderman's, go and watch them in their glory rather than this mismatched, overrated new addition to the increasingly tiresome MCU.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Hard to relate,"I was 8 years old when Sam Raimi's Spider-man came out and blew our mind. It was a move that mase us jump from couch to couch, just like spidey, quote the characters, and play through the movie in our backyard. Then we got Spider-man 2-3, later Amazing Spider-man 1-2 with Andrew Garfield and later Tom Holland's take on the role.

I always liked the dorky, relatable Peter, who struggles in life, has time management issues, tries to protect his friends, love interest and has real life problems. Tobey's version was perfect for this, and I think for this reason he's still the best Peter Parker.

Unfortunatelly I didn't like the Amazing Spider-man versions that much, the story wasn't that interesting, only the acting and the chemistry saved it between Andrew and Emma. But the ending - for me - was and still one of the boldest moment in standalone superhero movies. It was The Night Gwen Stacy died.

Tom Holland's spidey first came in Civil War, he was one of the many heroes in that movie, but he was likeable, fresh and fun so he got his standalone movies combined with following Avengers movies. Marvel always had issues with its movies. The antagonist is always the same (daddy issue) and the story never seen to risk big with one or two exceptions. We're always running the same circles.

But why did I had to write all these before even mentioning No Way Home? Because it seemed different, it seemed bold, risky and maybe fresh again. But then I went to see it.

My problem with Tom Holland's version of Peter that I can't relate. He's not dorky, he's actually talented and people recognize his talent. He has a bright future, love interests, a good friend, a loving environment and more importantly: always someone to look up, a mentor. He doesn't need to struggle finding his own path because its right in front of him and he knows it. No big struggle here. No everyday problems in his life.

No Way Home starts when Far from Home end credit scene ended: The world knows that he's spider-man and thinks he killed Mysterio. Big problem? Tony Stark told the world he was Iron Man, Captain America never had a secret life and so on. Just prove your innocence and that's it. No need to ask Strange to use his magic to forget the world that he's spider-man. But he does, and interferes with the spell, the multiverse cracks up and people starts to come to his world. Only the ones with the knowledge that Peter Parker is Spider-man. That means Octopus, Green Goblin, Lizard, Electro and Sandman. Ohh and the two other Peter Parkers. Because they're here.

So if you're not familiar with the old movies, this movie will mean almost nothing. Marvel did a 180 turn and said ""You need to know every superhero movie to understand this one"". Not just from the MCU, but every other. This was risky, probably payed off because the first movie is only 19 years old.

It's truly good to see all three Spider-mans sharing the screen, referencing memes, using their own skills. The problem is all the best and brightest moments are references to the old movies. Andrew is still a hell of an actor. You can tell, he didn't just catch MJ, he catched himself too (probably one of the best MCU moments). Tobey's interaction with Otto is sweet and throws back to your childhood. The problem is they're not pushing forward the main story, Tom Holland's character. He's somewhere there in the background with the problem: everyone needs to forget him. And they do. And I'm afraid that years later I'll forget him too, because his standalone trilogy was good because of the other 2 Spider-mans. Now he's only Spider-man, not Peter Parker.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Hard to say.,"This movie is grate . It could be better if there were little bit more actions of Tobey Spidey.

Film was awesome and enjoyable . Also we saw a serious side of Tom. How ever this is good.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,"By far, the worst Spider-man movie","Plot is a bit rubbish and popularity of former movies have been used to get some pulse. Imagination is OK, but should have been supported by coherence. It was not satisfying for me except for the visual effects.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,one of the greatest superhero films ever made,"This might be better than spider-man 2 and into the spider-verse.

This film delivered almost everything i wanted and even things that i expected going in still managed to surprise me. I was grinning from ear to ear almost the whole movie (aside from the sad scenes, which there's a few).

This was a pure joy to watch on opening night and im sure i will watch it many, many more times.

10.0,speechless,"Wow, the excitement buliding up to this film was definitely worth it! Everything's perfect, they couldn't have done it better. It's been almost 3 hours since i've seen the film and i'm lost for words. What a masterpiece!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,The Spiderman movie we needed all along.,"Not much to say. If you have been a huge fan of Spiderman since you were born like me, and watched the last couple of movies being sad and frustrated about them. Then this one solves the whole Spiderman puzzle. It makes all the live action franchises suddenly have a purpose. This is such a great way of connecting all the dots. What a great writing all over, great story and insain acting. Willem Defoe is just insain as green goblin. Sadly, I do not think we will ever get a movie with only him and spidey, but damn. What a performance by him and everyone else. I was impressed, and smiled all the way home. What a great experience this was!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Spoilers and Ideas ahead,"9.2 out of 10 Besides what could've been an extra scene, Spiderman No Way Home was awesome....the only thing I feel could've been better, is they could've and should've made this a 2 to even 3 movie film on its own, (I think 2 films, or a 4 hr story would've been more appropriate). No matter how many they made, or make, I feel Gwens' death will always take precedence of the others for loss and heartache, and Mays' in this one next. Now about the Venom ending...A hilarious twist would be venom being transferred back to his universe and going ocd on about seeing spiderman (Tom) then ..to find out he is in the same universe as Garfields Spider man, since tobey already had his, and introduces garfield to his mj through the story as well.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,This movie filled me with love and took all my tears,"This movie is absolutely beautiful, the storyline, the characters, the acting, the cinematography, the cast everything about this movie is amazing. Seeing this movie was such an emotional experience. I'm a big marvel fan and have been waiting for this movie for a long time, so finally seeing it was amazing, but also so emotional. This movie is absolutely insane, it gave me laughter, tears and it made me feel so many things. This movie is incredibly insane and I've never seen anything like it. The storyline is insane the cast is insane. This movie is freaking crazy dude.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,Awful,I wish I could give this 0 stars. This movie was a mess. It was sloppy. Acting was terrible. Dialogue was even worse. This movie was purely made for the big box office cash and nothing more. Nothing memorable about it I could go on but yeah I already wasted my time don't feeling like wasting more of it on this trash movie.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Unbelievable,"First of all, I am shocked that the level of animation and visual are too high and how they connected to audience emotionally. The Hype is real. In the third movie, they show the real Spiderman who lost their family and friends. I can feel his pain and I am literally got emotional and thought why that's happen why we lost that person which we love the most. It touches my heart. I would like to thank all team members who make this film thank you.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Kaboom from all sides,"No way home is my new favorite spidey movie...it's action sequence was beautifully done and shot...Director John watts has taken the audience to a next level, his entire concept and thoughts were displayed in this movie...loved to see the great Maguire once again,followed by amazing Garfield and young holland,with every villian makes this movie worth a watch....a 10/10 rating by me 😀",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Superb! Marvel Will Struggle to Top This One,"It's hard to write an adequate review of this movie without spoilers. Let's just say, bringing together characters from all three Spider-Man movie eras was masterfully pulled off. Very slick writing in this one. Great original storytelling, action, and feeling, with enough callouts to the other era films to satisfy the geek in every Spider-Man fan since 2002. Oh, and Willem Dafoe has still got it as the best Spider-Man villain ever. You will walk out of this one thoroughly entertained.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Spoiler Free Web Head!,"Wow just WOW! This movie...I went into this movie with nothing other than ""wow I bet this movie is going to be disappointing just from the over hype."" Yes I was expecting to disappointed just so I could not be disappointed. Let me tell you that this movie was breath taking. I felt every emotion through out this film...this MASTER PIECE! There's love, suspense, fear, heartbreak, sadness, and most of all satisfaction.

The reality that this movie brings to the MCU is just insane. I remember being 8 years old and watching the beginning of the super hero genre basically starting with Tobey. It is amazing to me that at almost 20 years later I can be shocked and amazed by something of this genre. Never a dull moment, Jamie Fox and William Dafoe steal the entire show! Zendaya and Tom are at their peak performances!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,The perfect blend,"I didn't think even MCU would be able to pull off so masterfully a movie with so many different characters, many of whom will need to be reintroduced, but they really did!

Somehow, they managed to do most of them justice, while not taking away from the story, while giving fan service, while making it compelling, while universe-building, while setting up future plots. It also mixed Spidey-like lighthearted humor with really touching, emotional moments without taking away from the gravity of the emotion, and that is simply masterful.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"Amazing, Spectacular & Ultimate Spider-man movie!","With great power comes great responsibility, Marvel, Disney and Sony have delivered quite possibly the pinnacle of superhero movies simply by following this mantra, pooling all of their vast resources into one, working together without ego proving that the power of 3 can truly be a wonderful thing.... I loved this movie, for the first time since the (covid) blip my local picture house was sold out, not only were there no empty seats but there were no dry eyes and no unsatisfied customers either.

Not since Cap lifted Mjiolnir and assembled the Avengers have I heard a room erupt with such rousing aplomb, which was only enhanced by the gasps, shocks and tears that sped the plot along from the opening scene to the closing shot.... quite simply a 'perfect' movie, not in the Schindlers List or Shawshank way but the way Back to the Future, Ghostbusters or Die Hard are 'perfect', they tick every box, they stand the test of time, they are simply classics and I have no doubt that No Way Home will be a welcome addition to the club. See it for yourselves, you will not be disspointed.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
3.0,Average marvel product with slightly more emotional gravity,"The ending is slightly more emotional than we are know average marvel movies. Benedict Cumberbatch is great, as always. The movie is a weird mixture of plot convince and fan service. At least not the worst one from the MCU.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A Dream Come True,"No Spoilers here but this is the most character driven Spidey film since Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2'. Everything in this movie is about the definition of Spider-Man, something that was somewhat lost in the first two Holland films. If you have grown up with each iteration of Spider-Man, all I will say is that this movie is everything you want it to be and more. It's about broken people who make mistakes and learn and I have not been this happy with a superhero movie since 'The Dark Knight'.

This is the MCU's best film!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Lets be honest.,"Lets be honest here A lot of what makes this movie good is based on nostalgia and fan service. The action was nothing extra, on multiple occasions I had a hard time of keeping up with what was actually going on beside ""they fight"".

The soundtrack in the mcu movies have always been kind of unnoticeable. Here they had a lot of opportunities to bring in the old tunes but I felt that the music never really kicked in

The bluetooth controlled arms?

Doc Ock coming to terms with his mistakes in Spider-Man 2 and overpowering the evil AI with pure will power was the coolest thing.

Here the AI in Peters suit hacked Doc Ocks robotic arms, put them both down and then restrained the arms.

This is the real AI to worry about.

Overall the movie was entertaining but a lot of things felt rushed. Bringing back the old guys was a great move I will give them that, this is also what raises the score for me.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,Simply Awful,"Wow...where to begin? Let's just say there's 2.5hrs of my life I'll never get back. I wish there was a zero star option.

8.0,Missing Spidey,"Would have been a 9 rating from me if they had included the original live action Spider-Man, Nicholas Hammond.

This film made me feel like life was normal again. A theater pack of people who love Spider-Man as much as me. I sat beside the coolest guy, and we started talking about Marvel and our love for it. We both became really close friends. This movie is without a doubt the best Marvel film yet. Including Avengers Endgame! 100% go watch this movie - Spider-Man: No Way Home!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Amazing ending to the trilogy!,"Spider-Man: No Way Home was so hyped that at some point I though this might be the second coming of jesus christ lmao. The movie was so hyped and people were really excited to see the film and it turned out pretty good (ofc it will because it has 3 spider-man's in it).

To start with the good things as always let's praise the CGi work here I mean almost 95% of the marvel movies have great CGi and here it's also the same case the CGi looked great, the film was packed with a lot of action sequences, the colors were on point, the choreography was excellent.

The story is simple and straight forward but it ignores the storyline in the 2nd half and focuses on the 3 spider-man's a lot I mean everyone knows who is spider-man but still dude is travelling here and there without having to worry about people and he's accused of being the person behind all the things happened in far from home. Also the villains don't add up that much into the film except greeb goblin others are just there and does nothing else it felt like marvel just added them so people won't ask them questions like 'where are the rest of the villains?' also this same case goes for andrew and tobey's spider-man having less screen time and dialogues but still they did their work in the film.

Marvel could've make it a lot better film if they didn't focused too much on the multiverse and doctor strange but still it's a good movie I pretty much enjoyed it myself.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,A childhood rollercoaster,"This problem started with Peter and his friends applying to MIT but then got rejected because of his revealed identity. Then somehow he went to Dr. Strange to change the course of his reality which ended up backfiring bringing up enemies from other multiverse.

This movie is no different to his previous movies which is caused by his foolishness.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,Too much unnecessary talking.,"I give the movie a 5 out of 10. Too much unnecessary talking and scenes that don't really add anything to the movie. Would been better if they edited out about 40 minutes. That being said, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina were the best part of the entire movie. The back-and-forth between their two characters was really good.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Not as good as the earlier spider movies,"The storyline in the first half is contrived and jarring. Once we get over that, then it's interesting. The earlier spiderman movies are smoother. Also, the emotional, or deep thinking parts of the movie is slow and drags. Better editing and faster pace there would have been good.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Good - not great,"I thought this movie was really good! Really enjoyed watching it and was so happy to see Tobey Maguire back as Spider-Man along with Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doctor Octavious.

I grew up with those movies so those will always be special characters/actors.

While the movie was good, really good, it wasn't as great as the 9/10 10/10 star reviews - there were definitely some plot holes in the movie (for example... why not just erase everyone's memory of what Mysterio told the world? That protects the Avengers, Jr. Avengers, & family and friends from forgetting who you are.

7/10 is a ""solid movie that you should watch if your fans of the genre"" but I definitely don't think it rises to the level of 9/10 ""everybody on earth should see this film"" and 10/10 ""this is one of the greatest films of ALL TIME."" It definitely was cool seeing the Spidey's together - but it didn't quite hit like that first Avengers movie.

Interested in seeing where Spider-Man goes from here - hopefully that he can restore MJs memory. Ned is definitely going to become a super villain at MIT and not remember that he is Spidey's best friend.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

8.0,Good film as all marvel films are... though its not a 10 or a 9 for that matter.,Very good film. However I can't fathom why it's rated the highest marvel movie ever. It can't rival infinity wars/end game or the GOTG 1/2 or winter soldier/civil war/black panther... A good film for nostalgia and some decent scenes however. Just doing the review as soo many are putting it on a pedestal that I'm sure is baffling the powers that be in the marvel universe.

9.0,Excellently-executed Spider-Man story.,"'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is the final piece of the MCU/Sony trilogy, all in under five years. It's also Holland's 6th time playing Peter Parker and essentially serves as 'Doctor Strange' 1.5, bridging to 'Multiverse of Madness' next year. This film picks up right where 'Farm From Home' left off, with the world now knowing Peter is Spider-Man, which make things very difficult for him, MJ (Zendaya), Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Ned (Batalon) and Happy (Favreau).

Peter goes to Dr Strange (Cumberbatch) for some magical help, which triggers a multiverse ""issue"", with - I don't think this is a spoiler after all the trailers & press - villains from the pre-MCU Spider-Man films being pulled into the MCU. This includes Dr Octopus (Molina), Green Goblin (Dafoe), Electro (Foxx), Sandman (Haden Church) and Lizard (Ifans) all trying to figure out why this Spider-Man is different. It borrows a bit from 'Into the Spider-Verse', which is a good thing, as that film is superb. Along with them, the big reveal is that the multiverse Peter Parker's - Toby Maguire (now 46) and Andrew Garfield (now 38) - are also pulled into this world. This provides both some funny and insightful moments.

Peter's close to losing control a few times here, and the final act does a good job of raising the stakes and helping him realise his role, his morality and mortality. There's quite a few touching moments, and with all MCU films, the ensemble works well here - it's great watching Peter, MJ and Ned together, and it's not too corny having the other two Spider-Men involved. Dafoe reminds us of what a good actor he is. All the throw-back villains and Maguire/Garfield could've made this seem like a lame cash-grab, but it really works. I had great time and enjoyed the simultaneous happy and sad ending.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Yeah this what I expected,"Bad cinematography Bad action/choreography.

Lack of characters depth - But yeah jon watts really has a genius idea to rebooting this spiderman again to make how spiderman really spiderman, cant wait to see spiderman 4 which i can see Peter Parker whos really lonely, struggling with his financial problem, trying to live as an ordinary person and a superhero, in love with someone, and friends and many more abt his personalities.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,TEARY-EYED NOSTALGIA,"I can't even write a long paragraph about this movie because the emotions I felt during this movie are impossible to explain. If you are a fan of previous spider man's you will absolutely adore this movie. All the complaints about Tom hollands Spider-Man are handled so well in this movie that it changed my whole perception of how I viewed his spider man and made him one of my favorite spider man's that is easily just as good as Tobey and Andrew's. I got teary eyed for many scenes and left feeling hopeful and optimistic aboht our world as a whole. I'm not a huge MCU fan but one thing I've noticed is that when there movies are on point, they give great messages about hope in the universe and make you want to be a better person. This movie delivers on all fronts and is easily a 10/10 movie IMHO.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,One of the best spiderman movies,"Movie was really good. Finally they give a proper story for Tom's spidy. Story was solid, no big deal. But i personally didn't like the way they introduce Toby and Andrew. CGI was bad sometimes.

I loved every second of it!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,"Lacking in Quality, but Entertaining","Spider-Man: No Way Home tried everything it could to appeal to the lowest common denominator in potential Spider-Man fans. Witty banter, callbacks to the Sam Raimi trilogy and the Amazing Spider-Man films, the list goes on and on. But the characters developed by the MCU for this Spider-Man franchise end up woefully lacking in any sense of depth or character as a result.

If you take a look at Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and the acting is great of course, the writing of his character falls into complete disarray when you attempt to understand any of his actions. Especially when you compare this portrayal to the comic version, you begin to see that this version of the character doesn't seem to actually embody any of the traits that the character relies on in order to actually connect with them emotionally. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is the hallmark of classic Spider-Man, and you see that even in the MCU-resurrected versions of Tobey and Andrew's respective portrayals of the character. However, Tom Holland's portrayal doesn't ever actually come to the point where his inaction with his power (which is the entire crux of the saying ""with great power comes great responsibility"") causes harm to anyone around him. Instead, it's great misuse of power that ends up hurting those he cares for.

Spider-Man's entire persona relies on the idea that, ""If I don't use my power to help others, then the next person that dies could be someone like Uncle Ben."" Tom Holland's Spider-Man never learns this lesson, and after 3 films, still fails to understand this basic foundation of the character.

There is the argument, of course, that this portrayal doesn't have to be ""accurate"" to the character's already established motivations and character traits. To this, I would say that you're entirely correct. But then, why would you bother attributing this jumbled up mess of character defects of a Spider-Man to the Peter Parker version? That character already exists, why would you not just create a new character if you intended on changing something so incredibly fundamental to how that character operates within a story?

Overall, I just think that this entire MCU Spider-Man franchise is a complete flop, story-wise. There is no real connective tissue throughout the three films, none of the main cast gets any development or even a casual step into any actual character depth, and the most recent film is lacking in even plot coherency.

When the only good parts of your film are the scenes where characters from better films are making cameos, then you can safely assume that your film is sorely lacking in any actual substance of its own.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Impossible,The 8th ranked highest rated movie of all time? Are you kidding me? This movie..... No its not. Not even close. I don't know how anyone could justify such a high score.

The theatre never settled from the moment it started to the last post-credit scene, people were cheering, crying, sometimes laughing, and clapping like crazy every time we saw a new character.

All the actors were great even better than their previous spider-man movies but tom holland honestly killed it in this one, he has matured very much from homecoming/far from home he is no longer iron boy jr as some people claimed in the past, in this movie we really got to see him become SPIDER-MAN. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but if you read the leaks and you think you know what in this movie, believe me, YOU ARE NOT READY.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,Why do I hate this movie?,"I think that the movie is unnecessary because after all the villains go back to their universe they still die or live on but as usual in the Films.

Otto Octopus has to destroy the power of the sun.

Connors still gets into prison.

Green Goblin basically kills himself by accident and so on with every single one.

I also didn't like that Peter a Person with an high iq doesn't come up with the idea of talking to College or do something at least.

The only thing that I liked about the movie was Tobey Maguire to be honest. William Dafoe also delivered an awesome performance as always but Spider Man 1-3 will always be my favorite Spider Man movies.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Best Spiderman Movie,"I am big fan of Spiderman Man movie.this movie. Shows us how important it is.

Story are very Interesting and the plot of is also very well.

VFX,CGI are just Next level.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Best mcu movie ever,Best mcu Moive ever the return of the best actors for spider man Andrew and tobey the acting was amazing and the moive was incredible and thank u marvel for the best mcu moive ever.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,"Would've given it 4, but the deliberately lazy making forced a 1","SPOILERS AHEAD! First off, the positives. The idea is really good and opened up so many ways in which the film could've gone. Willem Dafoe and Andrew Garfield give thoroughly entertaining performances, while the rest of the cast were pretty functional (yeah, Tobey seemed uninterested and JK Simmons was underutilized).

Now, I know Spiderman is a kid and all that but why would he possibly choose to save guys who would've killed at least 30 people in the action scene that they appeared in? Because May spouted some pseudo-wisdom? I know it seems like nitpicking but that's such a glaring characterization error. Hence, the plot is weak and entirely reliant on nostlagia to save the day (which it does, for MCU fans).

Raimi's trilogy really has good characters who actually have some chemistry between them and the scenes are wonderfully staged. In MCU spiderman, the laziness in filmmaking and production is evident. It's almost like Feige thought ""Okay we have this cool idea to bring back the other 2 so let's just whip up a movie"". Director Jon Watts' biggest hassle would've been to safeguard the secrecy of the cameos I guess. The CGI is awful in many scenes and the post credit scene which has a trailer for Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness shows a superior quality of making just from 1 or 2 minutes of footage.

As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I felt really bad for other directors who have a voice and really want to tell a story and give a cinematic experience, in a world where films like FFH, Black Widow and NWH are what the mass audiences want. At least it's good for the theaters as PTA said.

MCU is like the broiler chicken of film history. Filled with formulae and easy to make but long term impacts are, well...yet to be seen.

P. S: I opened an IMDb account just to write this review.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Nostalgic Masterpiece,"By far the greatest Spider-Man film and by far the greatest marvel film ever made! This really isn't your typical overhyped superhero film.

I enjoyed absolutely every minute of it and was amazed at the writing of the storyline linking both past and present.

I really don't think they could of done it any better and the nostalgic feeling from The Green Goblin & Dr Octo back with the original actors is something I've never felt watching a film before.

Thankyou so much to everyone involved in making this. 10/10.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Best Marvel movie. Better than End game.,"This film was full of emotions and every single scene had a meaning. It was great to see Spiderman challenge Doctor Strange and proof him wrong.

The opportunity for redemption was the main topic of this movie. It gives closure to the previous Spiderman movies and that makes it extremely emotional for the the audience.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
7.0,Overhyped,"So, I'm a huge fan of spider man character since the old TV cartoon 😅 and the Tobey maguire trilogy.

For Tom Holland's spider man I've seen only captain American Civil War movie Anyway, for almost a month I kept my self away from spoilers and only I watched some reviews.

Yesterday I decided to watch this movie And Guess what, it was cool a good entertaining superhero movie, but didn't affect me like what Avengers:End Game did Seriously, I was disappointed and upset about the overhyped talks and fuzz I can't deny that I liked some moments in the movie but I think so many aspects needed some explanation I guess My fav. Character in this movie is Dr. Strange and I'm so excited to watch his next movie.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Finally!,Marvel did with Spider man what Sony could NEVER do AND will NEVER achieve. Live action multiverse. Everything was perfect and I hope Spidey stays with Marvel and in time Spiderman characters from Sony can be introduced in the MCU cuz Sony have no idea what they are doing.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"Review of the film - ""Spider-Man, there is no way back""","One of the most epic, large-scale and daring films. Holland showed almost the best game since the beginning of his career, his partners in the film received unexpectedly a lot of screen time. And the general idea and ending of the film finally bring the story of Spider-Man to the point that is known and loved by fans.

It is easy to blame the authors for the fanservice and the obvious play on the feelings of fans of previous franchises: without constantly heated rumors and hopes for the appearance of certain actors, the picture would not be so interesting. But in reality, such a film has a huge target audience. He will please your long-time relatives, many of whom Molina was one of the first screen villains, and fans of the entire amazing cast of actors, and even the younger generation. After all, for those who have become attached to the Spider performed by Holland, two more amazing spider universes are now opening up, which will never be continued - but they managed to return them from oblivion.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,"Missed the mark, should have been better","Left me bored and wishing it was written and directed by someone else.

It had the chance to be great, but was more like a depressing drama with rushed in action scenes.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,AWESOME,"Simply spectacular, from beginning to end it is a carousel of emotions that make you cry and get excited. You have to go if or if as soon as possible to see this movie, if you like Spiderman and Marvel, you are going to cry and you are going to scream with emotion.

Art.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,I thought I would love it but I didn't,This movie has great moments on it. Having all the bad guys from previous Spider-Man movies was fun and made for some great moments. The reasonings for all of this made little to no sense. After getting outed as Spider-Man Peter Parker upends the lives of his best friend Ned and his girlfriend MJ. For some reason he thinks changing this event would help his friends go back to normal and goes to Dr. Strange to make this happen. Well because Spider-man is an insecure mess he messes up the spell due to the fact that Peter Parker can't make up his mind. This causes people from other worlds to come to his such as Green Goblin and Electro. For some reason Peter Parker wants to save all of these people and lets them loose with dire consequences. That part made no sense to me. Why save the nemesis of Spider-man? The fact Tobey Mcguire and Andrew Garfield are in this movie made it more fun. The ending was just stupid and made no sense to me. How does changing the fact that no one knows he's spider-man alter his relationsihps with Ned and MJ. They knew him from school so that shouldn't have changed. I was dissapointed by this movie. I.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,Where was Paul Pogba in all of this?,"This movie did not meet my expectations at all!!

After wha I have seen on the internet, I had expected Godzilla in this. As a massive kaiju fan this is really disheartening. Terrible movie on top of all of this as well, waste of time would not reccommend at all!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Marvel at its finest!,"What I truly loved about Spider-Man No Way Home is that it managed to perfectly encapture every emotion you could want to experience in a movie - there is humor, love, heartache, fear, anger - everything is perfectly blended together to give us a fully emotion-packed event that tugs you in every single direction. There was honestly not a single dull moment from the first scene up until the second post-credit scene!

The visuals were mind bending, and the acting was absolutely phenomenol - with standouts 1000% being Tom Holland, Zendaya, and one other person who for me stood out thanks to the humor and heart that they brought to the movie!",Spider-Man: No Way Home

5.0,Spoilers...yikes on that ending,"To an otherwise awesome series. It's so depressing. Sure it ties up loose ends...but by killing off main characters and robbing memories? Character assassination in leiu of a plot is just lazy.

The little references were cute I guess. Charlie Cox showing up as Matt Murdock made me miss the Daredevil series.

Yeah just a depressing away to end a great series, sorry.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Totally fantastic,My friends and i binged every spider man movie a few nights before this came out and no way home was my favorite of all of them. A perfect finale to an amazing trilogy. One of my favorite superhero movies.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,A spectacular film,"Spider-Man: No Way Home is all-around great. One highlight is the star-studded cast, all providing enticing performances. In aid is the often perfect dialogue and fitting writing that does justice to the characters of multiverse past, especially in relation to the current trilogy's pre-established cast. Character development is therefore highly satisfying, the film sporting a fantastic emotional depth that is even supported by the solid comedic moments within. The emotional impact the feature presents is entirely heartbreaking, yet wholly fulfilling all the same. With so much to work out, the writing proves to be all around good. There are no dull or wasted sequences, altogether. Particularly, the placement of all the characters within the storyline is well decided. Momentum towards the climax is never lost, with shocking and exciting moments continually pushing the audience forward and deeper into the film. The resolution is highly satisfactory, showcasing the greatest strengths and flaws of each character. However, the first act and therefore the set up to what occurs is somewhat questionable. It feels as though this part of the film was rushed so the plot would quickly move into the more meaningful second and third acts. This ultimately proves slightly redeemable, though, upon viewing the spectacle that follows. Thematically, the movie delivers various meaningful messages that are completely developed and an obvious purposeful reflection of the Spider-Man character as a whole that the previous Holland Spider-Mans had been focusing into. As always with the MCU, visuals are captivating and the action sequences are suspenseful and intriguing. Editing and sound are additional highlights of the film, seamlessly weaving what happens into a logical, exciting storyline. Overall, the attention to detail in this film is wonderful. Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awesome feature that deserves much praise.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
5.0,Disappointing,"This was the worst of all the modern Spiderman movies. I believe the main reason so many people like it is because of all the stars in the movie, but the writing is bad, the directing is poor, and the editing is odd.

It began terribly, then transitioned to OK, then to disappointing. It failed to make me feel what was intended except for once. Too many characters acted like Peter Parker--nervous and lacking in confidence, with the same mannerisms depicting these. There were several fast cuts during scenes when we are supposed to feel the depth of the characters' emotions. A death was shown while I am still anticipating a battle with villain, which denied me the ability to feel sadness from the death. I hate Spiderman's dark blue suit; he isn't Batman (please studios, stop copying Tim Burton). These are only some complaints.

This phase of Marvel is sucking.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
9.0,Amazing,The movie was great but it really depended on nostalgic moments for old spiderman fans that loved their Spidermen which really is a down for a great movie like this.,Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,A M A Z I N G,"OMG this is the best movie ive ever had in the past years, feels like a brand new experience and in a way that is awesome, this review will contain spoilers so DONT SCROLL DOWN

When i first saw Doc Ock everybody in the cinema started screaming, with Osborn it was kind of the same.

THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE is when Ned starts opening a portal and OMG! IT WAS AWESOME DAMNNNNN, MJ and Ned screaming to Andrew ¨Peter, Peter¨!

Later on appared TOBEY MAGUIRE, LITERALLY EVERYBODY STARTED SCREAMING.

My favorite parts was when Andrew said ""I love you guys"" and then they started SWINGING OMGGG

This is my review, its great, AWESOME, and its the greatest movie of SpiderMan or maybe the best of superheroes.

10.0,This is how you should make your audience feel,"As a child who grew on Tobey Maguire spider man and as a big fan of the MCU this movie was the best in every parameter: Story ✅ Comedy ✅ Stand in the expectation ✅

All and all just one of a great movie I have ever seen and I watched Avengers endgame.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Was a roller coaster for me.,"The 1st spiderman that I saw, when I was 6 or 7 years of age. And from childhood, I have always been a fan of spiderman. And now seeing all of them together, after a very very long time, I can't elaborate how nostalgic I was. This movie is beyond any rating. It's our luck that we get to see this. It's a one-time opportunity movie. Watch it and just go with the nostalgia. Happy watching..",Spider-Man: No Way Home
1.0,Disappointing,"Villains were standing around most of the movie. Tobey was hugely wasted. Makes no sense whatsoever how he doesn't even acknowledge that the man he watched Die (Norman Osbourne) and btw his dead best friend's dad, is living before him in the flesh. No shock, no emotion. Even just for a small moment. Didn't need to take away Tom's shine at all. The director or Marvel says, hey let's give him a moment with Doc Ock! It's just really mind boggling how they go out of their way to be mediocre. This movie is just as bad as the other films of the trilogy. It's boring. It's depressing. Peter in this movie is very annoying and unbelievably naive, even for what most people will say is excusable because he's ""just a kid."" No one cared enough for this Aunt May to die as much as we would have cared for the Aunt May from Tobeys universe because we felt their connection. Lets be honest the relationship with Happy was weird. Happy crossed a major boundary slamming Peter's aunt. Totally uncomfortable. If anyone thinks I should be grateful because at least we see all three generations of Spidey on screen, I don't understand the logic. If I get free ice cream and it tastes like dog turd I'm not gonna be thrilled and say ""hey at least it's free ice cream!"" Im allowed to say what I dislike. Stop settling for mediocrity when better films have been made.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,THE BEST SPIDER MAN MOVIE EVER.....!!,This movie is the freakn best spiderman film so for . Omg the theatre experience was on an entirely different level. It completely exceeded my expectations. MUST WATCH GUYS DONT MISS THIS.......!!,Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,"So many great characters, so little plot","Sadly this movie had no plot. It's heavily character-driven and relies solely on decisions based off of Spider-Man's feelings and logic doesn't play a role.

It has a lot of fan service in it. A few of the characters felt out of place and the only believable villain was Green Goblin (seriously Willem Dafoe stole the show).

The jokes were not as cringey as in other recent Marvel movies and the cinematography is also good.

All in all they relied too much on the cast and characters to carry. They are great, but they had no story to tell. Only a lot of funny dialogue with a sprinkle of (in my opinion) unnecessary drama that only provided shock value.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,NON SPOILER REVIEW: Fan Service 100,"Honestly fully confident this is not only the best spiderman film, not only the best marvel film, not only the best superhero film. BUT the BEST film that I personally have EVER seen in my lifetime. I found myself subconsciously clapping and just screaming inside with joy. The returns of some characters are incredible. The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland. This movie is fan service central and i'm here for it.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

1.0,Seriously do not understand the positive reviews,This film is complicated and without adding details to spoil it for anyone. It try's to be a comedy throughout that then jumps into high action sequences that in themselves are well made but trying to add to a story that is poor with so plot errors and attempts to just pull so many things together that it becomes tiresome. As a fan of the wonderful original spider man comics. Why not loose the comedy keep the story dramatic with strong character development. The Joker was a perfect example of how to get it right but I'm completely bemused by the positive reviews for this film. I would love to list the faults one by one but you can see them for yourself and hopefully pick up on the childish sentiment that is also tightly woven into this pointless film.,Spider-Man: No Way Home

7.0,Not as good as expected but still very good.,"Tbh i thought electro would be a lot cooler villain. They could've done a lot more with him for the last battle scene (at least they gave him a better haircut). Sandman was kinda boring and didn't do much either. Really the only person that had a good battle scene between Tom Holland was Green Goblin. Other than that the fight scenes were pretty underwhelming to say the least. At least they had Andrew and Tobey in the movie though so that kinda made up for it. I nearly cried when Aunt May died. You could really feel Tom's emotions. After she died, you could tell he wanted to give up and didn't want to try anymore. Pretty good movie other than the fight scenes.

There is no doubt that this is the most ambitious, exhilarating Spider-man film to date. This exceeded all expectations and had the whole audience on the edge of their seats. Jon Watts really outdid himself at directing the film.

Spider-man Now way Home is perfectly balanced with action, drama, humour and emotion with almost no dull moments

Willem Defoe's return as the infamous green goblin is phenomenal! His facial expressions really show how talented he is at playing this iconic villain.

No way Home has everything, You will Enjoy every scene. It is very Nostalgic. How the script has been well written. They make every fans dream true. Comedy, Emotions, Fight Squence, Conversations everything was best. All the Cast have gave wonderful performance. I was waiting for this movie for 2.5 years. It is best spider man movie ever, how they make spider man famous then in climax do the best thing with spider man, That is Spider Man does. No complaints but I just have a doubt, where as Doctor Strange took so many time to learn magic, Ned just did easily. Overall Movie is Best. Every minute it gives nostalgia.

10.0,Sometimes the end of one adventure is just the beginning of another,"I saw Spider-Man: No Way Home last night and I had to put together a review because this was not only one of the best MCU movie ever made but also one of the best superhero movies ever made. So here we go (Huge spoilers ahead!):

Plot Breakdown:

So the movie kicks off right after the end credits scene from Far From Home and Peter has to deal with the consequences of the world finding out he is Spider-Man. He, MJ, Ned and May are questioned but nothing sticks as Mr. Murdock comes to help them. Then they move to another apartment in an attempt to escape the growing mob attacking Peter's house. At the same time MJ, Ned and Peter try to apply for MIT but they all get rejected which sets the main plot and the future films with Spider-Man perfectly. They all get rejected and Peter goes to Doctor Strange to have everyone forget that he is Spider-Man. Doctor Strange agrees and does a spell to have everyone forget Peter was Spider-Man, but Peter tempers with the spell and tries to alter it mid-way through and that changes the spell in a way in which not even Strange knows how it would turn out. So Peter finds out from Flash that a vice chancellor from the MIT is travelling to the airport so he goes to talk to her and convince her to let Ned and MJ in the MIT. This is where doc Ock attacks and he unmasks Peter to see that he isn't his Peter. Ock's arms get taken over by Peter's suit, but then the Green Goblin attacks and Spider-Man and Ock get teleported into Strange's prison. Then Strange explains that the spell worked in the way that it pulled all the people who knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man. He also caught the Lizard and placed it into the prison. So they plan to capture them all and send them back. So Peter brings Ned and MJ to help him with catching the villains. The next is Electro... so Peter goes into a forest and there he gets attacked by Electro but saved in the last minute by Flint Marko. He destroys the electricity towers and then cages the Electro. After that Norman comes to May and Peter takes him to the rest of the villains. Then Strange comes and he and Spidey fight over getting the bad guys home or helping them. That was one of the most craziest fight scene I've seen in the MCU. Peter ultimately wins with a genius display of Peter's intelligence, traps Strange in the mirror dimension and takes his ring which opens portals. They fix then Octavius but then Peter senses something is off. So Green Goblin and Electro storm off and May gets killed by Goblin's glider. This was heartbreaking to see happening to Peter, after first losing Tony his father figure in Endgame. Then we see MJ and Ned who are back at Ned's home deciding if they ought to activate the box Strange made to destroy the original spell. Then Ned opens a portal and a Spider-Man comes through and it's Andrew Garfield's Spidey. Then he tries again and finds Tobey Maguire's Peter. They find Tom together with Ned and MJ and talk him out of sending all the Spideys and villains back (Just a quick disclaimer, I will be naming the different Peters and Spideys by their respective actors names). Then they develop a cure for everyone and go the statue of Liberty in order to draw them all out and fix them. At first the three Spider-Men don't work together too well but after a quick pep talk they swing together and manage to cure Electro, Lizard and Sandman. The last being the Goblin who comes and destroys the scaffolding from the Statue and MJ falls while Tom tries to save her but he is then taken by the Goblin so Andrew jumps after her and saves her. The fight ends with a fantastic fist fight between Tom and Norman and as Tom was about to impale him with his glider Tobey comes and stops him only to be stabbed by the Goblin. Then Andrew throws the cure to Tom and he cures him. The movie ends with Tom suggesting Strange who was brought back by Ned, to make another spell to make everyone forget he is Peter and that would stop the first spell. Everyone forgets Tom's Spidey was Peter and then Peter goes to MIT and moves into his own apartment (Tobey vibes there... the only thing that was missing was mr. Ditkovich asking him for rent) and starting his own life of being the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man with a new hand-made comic book-ish costume.

End of Plot Breakdown

This was without a doubt for me, one of the best MCU movies, right up there with Infinity War and Endgame. You will hear many people say this is the most fan service fan service could be. But this movie isn't all about that. There are way more great things this movie does. The 2 standouts aside from Tom Holland (because this is his movie) for me were Willem Defoe and Andrew Garfield. The latter one has so much fun with his character. It is incredible to see what a great actor he is and what an amazing Peter Parker he can be with a competent script. I loved him in this movie even though I didn't really liked him in his own 2 movies. Willem Defoe is I would say the greatest shine overall in all the Spider-Man movies. He is truly incredible after all these years playing the Goblin with the same menace and cunning that made him a legend in the first Raimi movie. What I also loved about this movie is that they not only brought the villains from the Tobey and Andrew's movies but they also improved them, and I'm not talking only in terms of costume (which were improved for Electro and Goblin) but also their characters especially Electro and the Lizard which suffered the most in the Garfield's movies. Also the villains interactions were mesmerizing. To see Doc Ock and Norman interact with each other after being in separate movies in Raimi's original trilogy was truly a dream come true. Also Electro and Lizzard's interactions were neat. The only one that felt a bit like a spare wheel was Lizard, who in terms of plot didn't have much to do and affect the story. Another not so great thing was Doc Ock. Props though for Alfred Molina for coming back after all these years and still portraying doc Ock in the way we knew him. The only gripe I might have with his portrayal is that he gets less screen time than other villains and he at times is played for jokes. Him being cured at the mid point of the movie meant he wasn't part in the big battle at the end but only cured Electro and met with Tobey. It was okay overall, can't fault the movie for that, it was the obvious path for his character. But the best thing in this movie has to be the interactions between the three Spider-Men. They felt like they were brothers all this time and they all had a big part in the movie not only appearing for a cameo at the end to help Tom's Spidey. The best scene concerning the three Spider-Men has to be Andrew's rescue of MJ which redeems his character in way I never thought possible, and quite frankly it has to be one of the best character redemption scenes in any movie ever! Next one was Tobey's Peter stopping Tom from impaling Norman with his own glider. This time he stops Norman from getting killed with his own glider and also pays a small price for that by getting stabbed. Also, the ending is probably the best ending to a MCU movie and maybe to a Spider-Man movie. Speaking of Spider-Man movies, you could really see there was a vision here for Tom's version. To have him grow from a kid in the first two movies into a definitive hero by the end of this movie. It's so satisfying to watch that and it really puts to shame other studios trilogies that bombed, had no plan from the beginning and brought original members from older movies only for cheap nostalgia pandering to then disrespect them. This movie respects and honors every other Spider-Man movie that came before and moves the story in an interesting new direction building the main character properly in the process. It wouldn't be fair to talk only about the positives and not pin point some flaws this movie had: like the first half of hour of this movie has some off-placed humor and some strange behavior from characters like Ock and Tom's Peter with Strange when he does the spell. Even though this is the kick-start of the plot it is kind of weirdly executed and a bit cringy at time. This gripe I would say it's only present in the first 30 minutes - 1 hour of the movie. The first part of the movie is the one that seems a bit more like a comedy with some cringe inducing moments and humor that either hits or misses. After the point doc Ock appears in the highway the movie picks up and there's no turning back. Also there's a joke before the big battle at the end with Tobey's back which seemed a bit strange. I would have rather have that Spider-Men pointing at each other meme done in the scene. But these minor gripes won't take away from what was truly a remarkable movie that honored everything that came before it and prepared the way for a new story going forwards. I wish more movies were made like this one today. This will truly be remembered as a landmark in superhero movies and in franchise movies in generally. 10/10

One last thing before I go... there were so many people involved in making this movie. I encourage you to support the creators of this movie because they truly deserve and go see the movie in theatre. Let's show movies like these should get made more often!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
,Amazing Spiderman movie. (All puns intended),"This will be a non- spoiler review so feel free to read it all.

Experience: The cinema was cheering and howling from the very beginning, I had a similar reaction. The number of people in the cinema was about 70-75 or more than that. The cinema's response on every scene was fantastic, everybody was weeping and crying and laughing and hooping and what not. As expected. Throughout the movie I laughed, I cried, sometimes both, and my tears blended, my face whole wet with tears. Even when the credits were rolling I wasn't sitting there with that heart pulse, I was impressed and just lost and in awe of how good this movie was.

Summary: This movie felt like an authentic Spiderman movie, it was funny, exciting, action-packed. It takes its time, It feels like a pure Spiderman with the themes. It chooses to explore the stakes and the consequences from beginning to end. It does have that Endgame quality where you're like ""Wow, they are doing something big"" It rectifies the previous Tom Holland movies with confidence. And with hard decision-making. This, to me, felt like the most authentic Spiderman/Peter Parker movie I've seen in a long time.

Tom Holland's Performance: This is easily Tom's best performance. He is freaking fantastic in this movie, he's incredible.

What to expect: This is a Spiderman movie that will give you certain things that you want and also some things that are challenging and that hurt. Whether that be in emotional aspect or even in action. In a way, I don't know if it's only me but some action scenes felt more like violence than action in some cases. I was swept up in this.

Plot: It was darker than the trailers led on, It's way more emotional. I'm in awe of how I got much more than I expected, it's full of surprises from beginning to end. Even after hearing certain things on how they will go plot-wise. Watching the execution was much more surprising in that regard.

. Execution: As a huge Spiderman fan, It went through every single issue I've had with Spiderman in comics or even in general. I've read some Spiderman comics too. The movie did it in a way that felt smooth and plotted out in a way that it feels that Its plot and story and drama are written over the last 10 years. It gave me Spiderman that felt so true to its character and it felt like it fits with what we've had with Tom Holland.

Visuals: INCREDIBLE visuals, the way they executed it, throughout the number of beautiful visuals and even in the fight scenes, its something spectacular. Puns intended.

Direction: John Watson's direction in this is fire. He learned style. There is tension throughout this movie, there's emotion, there's beautiful scene work, the visuals, everything about this is fantastic chef kiss.

The Score: Incredible score, soundtracks, the composition, full of emotions and bad-ass music. Overall incredible.

Sinister Six: I personally think Green Goblin Is the best in this movie, absolutely fantastic. He was better in this movie than he was in the first movie. He's so menacing, so insidious, and overall such a great performance. The movie establishes the character better than I've ever seen in the live-action. With lizard and sandman, it felt two-dimensional, they lost some three-dimensional stuff that you would hope for. They still kept the three-dimensional stuff with Electro and Doc Ock. But the one that stood out the most was Green Goblin. They make specific and certain choices they make with Sandman and Lizard that I wasn't too fond of, can't go into details as to why. There were certain parts where I was like ""I don't know why they chose to do it like that but okay"". But overall all of them were enjoyable to watch, and a nostalgic trip back to the 2000's.

Rating: This is easily the best Spiderman movie I've seen after Tobey's Spiderman trilogy and Andrew's TASM 1 and 2. A solid 9.5/10 from me.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,"With great stakes comes great expectations. And boy, were those expectations exceeded.","This movie is... incredible. Out of all the Spider-Man movies I have seen (The original Raimi trilogy and the MCU trilogy), this one is the best. And that's saying a lot, because Spider-Man 2 was an absolute masterpiece that made me really appreciate not just Spider-Man, but Peter Parker, the boy behind the mask who wants so desperately to live two separate lives, one as a superhero with the responsibility to save the lives of the people around him, and another as just a regular, gold-hearted kid with friends and family. All that being said, however, the reason I like No Way Home more than Spider-Man 2 is because I had not actually seen the Raimi trilogy until AFTER I saw No Way Home, as that movie is what made me realize how deep Spider-Man actually is and that I wanted to look more into him. So, me loving this movie the most is almost definitely because of my personal experience with it. It sparked my interest in the webbed hero with just a kid behind the mask, and it did so while also living up to the expectations of long-time veterans and fans of him. This movie is an absolute must see if you are at all interested in Spider-Man. While it may not be perfect and have its flaws (like the pacing at some points being a bit weird and having quite a slow, drawn-out startup), it is still an absolute masterpiece in the Marvel series, and the writers, directors, and all others involved in the making of this film can be happy knowing that Stan Lee is smiling down upon them from heaven, truly proud of how his beautiful character and universe is being carried on to soar high.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
2.0,Childish disney touch,"Too elaborate, boring, at times soporific. 150 unnecessary minutes to explain a story. I honestly don't like the Disney touch in marvel movies. Ornate script worthy of a patchwork of scripts and comics from the Spiderman series. Unnecessary to include doctor strange in a role of ""machine"" in the service of Disney chimeras. After the avengers, these types of movies are so empty ... so boring, that they make you wish the movie is over once and for all. Thank God I was able to leave the cinema without falling asleep. The only positive point is the stellar appearance of several characters.

If you are going to watch the movie, get ready to be sold once again starwars merchandising, lego and really useless scenes of love, friendship and second opportunities. Cheap disney vintage illustrated & children's books of whatever.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

The Familia faces seen through out the movie are use so well and each spider-man has an emotional connection to the other.

3.0,Save your money...,"Pros: A couple good one liners Great effects and CGI Fun to see multiple characters together

Cons: Lazy script and drawn out ""emotional scenes"" Awful plot and storyline Ridiculous premise and execution WAY, WAY too long of runtime Ultimately just boring, they clearly aren't making these type of ""films"" for my type of audience.

Save your time and money. Rent it, watch it one time, move on. Not a movie you will own or rewatch, unless you are forced. :)",Spider-Man: No Way Home
4.0,Another Over-Hyped disney-marvel movie....,"First off, this was better than the last one but not by much. For the record, I think marvel has done some great films such as Iron Man, Captain America Civil War, Winter Soldier, The Avengers films, Guardians of the Galaxy 1, but the others have generally felt okay to meh.

The new spidey once again has spidey needing a bunch of help from other ""avengers"" and even some ""other people whom I don't want to spoil"". Add to that, the increased screen time of the wanna-be MJ (I really can't stand the character, actress (if you can call her that) and the changing of a beloved character), a mellow-dramatic spiderman, and lame incorporation of past villians.

The action is good but the sound is typical disney trash as it's too flat. Overall, there are some good things tossed in the film but it's not enough to bring it to being as good as Homecoming (even though I didn't think it was that great as well).

I often feel as if the audiences of today have been fed so many bad films that they have become accustomed to bad films that if anything is slightly better than that it's considered GREAT. Add to this problem are the countless so called ""professional"" reviewers who constantly praise disney/marvel because they don't want to lose their precious free viewing to films before the public (disney has gone after reviewers for giving negative reviews). Basically, if you like the crap being put out I'm sorry for you, but it is what it is.

This film is a easy pass and I wish I could get the hours back that I wasted seeing this.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

8.0,Nostalgia and multiverse to end a cycle.,"I've never really liked Spider-Man. He's a good kid, good as Job. I can't relate. I was more cynical at 8 than our latest version at 16 post-Thanos.

Now, he's exposed (his identity is known) and accused of the murder of a (fake) hero. Nick Fury threw him to the wolves for turning him down, welcome to reality !

This movie brings different stages of evolution via the multiverse. Three for the price of one, 10 years apart from each other. Plus a multitude of great actors that reprise their role as villains from previous movies

The scenes with Dr Strange aren't half bad, in real life and in the mirror dimension. The adult fights for order, the kid for ideals, for one day he keeps the adult away and he's going to pay for his naiveté if you know the previous movies.

Works for me. Peter parker is just a teenager. Usually. 30 and 40 years old versions come to the rescue.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,The Greatest Of All Spider-Man Movies,"I went to see this expecting a typical Tom Holland as Spider-Man movie, I came out wishing the next chapter in his story would come out in a week! There was so much going on in this movie but the directors handled the comedy and seriousness well. Although some said the lines were forced I believe this movie was funny for a marvel movie. Although Aunt May dying on screen was something of a shock, and seeing Tom Holland's Peter Parker go on a rampage against Green Goblin was a little scary, the movie was mostly positive. Don't get me wrong those scenes were necessary for the plot, they were just something to behold in a movie trilogy usually so upbeat. Also the pairing up of the Spider-Men was epic. Like I can't see any scenario we're they could have made it better. And the end of it all, Peter (Holland) is just a nobody. Because he chose to be Spider-Man, he chose to give up his life to help others, he gave up his friendships and love life as Peter Parker to be a full time Spider-Man. His down-to-earth suit in the end marks the transition from techy Iron Man inspired Peter as Spider-Man to a Friendly neighborhood vigilante crime fighter who wants to do what's right. And that is who Spider-Man is no matter which actor of comic rendition. Thank you for reading my honest opinion of this great movie.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

4.0,"Behind the blow, it feels that marvel studios and Sony are still at odds","The film contains fans service aplenty, however I believe this was used to cover up the waning relationship between two major companies and the inner battle for ownership over arguably the most valuable and popular superhero in a franchise's arsenal.

Major plot decisions made no sense when there where more multiple and easier options for the character, and the ending literally felt like they were writing him out of any further/future projects that he may be able to appear in. I hope that I am wrong, but this really did feel like a forced swan song.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

10.0,Good always has consequences,"Fanservice and nostalgia are trends of the last decade. And Marvel Studio mastered them in the first rows, sometimes skillfully, and sometimes not really playing on fan feelings. Therefore, it is not very surprising that at some point the studio decided to play with the multiverse and, in particular, spidervers. In fact, this whole scenario trick that Marvel pulled off was created for just one thing - retcon. This is initially an overly drawn line with Stark and a bunch of free technologies from him. Peter's poverty is not a special one, a small number of everyday problems, a huge arch with Avengers for such a long-playing character at the beginning of the journey, and so on. All this, including the lack of a clear backstory, was literally rolled back to what the fans demanded - Peter's independence, his independence and isolation from the rest.",Spider-Man: No Way Home

,A treat for Spider-Man and Marvel Fans Everywhere,"This review will not contain any spoilers, except what was already shown in trailers.

I friggin' loved this movie. In my opinion, this is easily one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, and easily one of the best MCU movies.

Director Jon Watts and writers Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers clearly understand Spider-Man. The action and spectacle is wonderful, and the story manages to keep a heartfelt and emotional core. And the moments of Fan-Service are delivered flawlessly. The first half of the movie isn't groundbreaking, but the second half is easily one of the most fun and exciting theater experiences I have ever had. The first half is good, but the second half is literally perfect.

Performances were fantastic all around. This is easily Tom Holland's best outing as Peter Parker, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is excellent as well. Jacob Batalon and Zendaya do well as Ned and MJ respectively, and there are very strong performances from returning villains like Alfred Molina's Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx's Electro.

However, the standout of the film is without a doubt Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. If you thought he was insane in Spider-Man 2002 (Which is was) then you will be blown away by his performance in this film. He manages to somehow take his near-perfect character portrayal from nearly 20 years ago and make it better. Truly impressive.

Like every other MCU film, the technical aspects are top-notch. The VFX look incredible, and this movie has some of the most creative and exciting action sequences in a Marvel film since ""Doctor Strange."" Michael Giacchino's score is excellent like the previous two films, and the little nods and winks to fans are scattered throughout brilliantly.

""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is easily in my Top 5 movies of 2021, and is an explosive, emotional, hilarious, and action-packed love letter to Spider-Man fans everywhere. It's astounding that it managed to live up to the hype and even surpass it. Big congrats to Jon Watts, Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers, the Entire Cast, and everyone involved with this incredible film. (Except Avi Arad)

Like almost every other movie, it isn't perfect, but it delivered just about everything a Spider-Man film should. 10/10.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
8.0,For the fans,"If you're a spider fan then this is a great conclusion to this series. Starting out the movie felt a bit slow but as soon as it picks up, it doesn't slow down.

Overall nice conclusion and possibilities for the next series and arc of the SpiderMan.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,More than I expected,"I'm a huge Spider-Man fan ever since I can remember.

I had high expectations and I'll admit I was kinda worried that it was going to be a bad movie or it would get bad reviews since a lot of people had problems with ffh. But just wow! It was more than I could imagine, this makes my inner 5 year old self jump and cry with excitement.

This movie just blew my mind, I loved every minute of it!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
10.0,Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"Briefly, point by point, and without spoilers.

Marvel Studios made a very sweet and unexpected gift for everyone that has so much emotional nostalgia, so you might even cry in some moments.

The cast of the movie is something amazing from one side and unbelievable from another side, so ultimately you will really feel the Doctor's Strange magic.

If you are a fan of ""Spider-Man"" comics and cartoons, you will most likely be surprised how close this movie is to the original comics/cartoons plot-concept of the story.

The ending of the movie and the post credits scenes, will give you a one great feeling. It is about the story with ""Avengers"" which did not end and looks like we have to expect something close to the ""Avengers"" series of movies. Yes, continuation of the adventure ;)

Last but not least, do not read, watch, or listen to anything and anybody on the Internet. Watch a trailer, find a good time, and enjoy this wonderful movie.

Hey, are you still here!? Then turn off the computer and run to the cinema!",Spider-Man: No Way Home
6.0,Enjoyable but underwhelming,"Enjoyable movie, however, the loads of fan service and plot holes kept taking me out of the movie.

3.0,Disappointing big boy,"Really, really general, after so many years, after so many things, it is hard to imagine that Spider-Man did not grow up, should really be that ""Men are juvenile to the very end""?

10.0,Spectacular Spider-Man,"Everything that every Spider-Man fan was hoping for, No Way Home creates a collision of continued MCU storytelling with pure nostalgic joy.

Two and a half hours fly by as viewers are repeatedly hit with exciting reveals, in a film virtually impossible to properly review without spoilers. Simply put; a great (and mostly importantly, coherent) plot which has depth without becoming convoluted, the return of some of the fan-favourite villains, each updated without losing their charm, and an enforced investment from viewers.

CGI and action scenes are brilliant, giving the likes of Doc Ock and Green Goblin the opportunity to revel in greater special effects. Plus the acting is just as good as it was nearly 20 years ago - Dafoe is superb yet again and even given the capacity to improve upon his previous goblin. Electro is hugely improved upon, stripping away the goofy style of The Amazing Spider-Man, and Sandman is kept consistent. Lizard still looks pretty stupid, but who cares. Honestly, the villains don't each get that much individual screen time, but there's so much else going on that it doesn't become a hindrance.

It not a perfect film, but for someone who was a child when the original Spider-Man trilogy came out and has followed this character on screen since, it brings everything together, and is just joyful.",Spider-Man: No Way Home
